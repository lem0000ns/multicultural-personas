Ji-ko-29,Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Assam's society?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Assam's society. Hmm, Assam is a state in India, right? I know that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some Asian cultures, the 50th birthday is a big deal, like a ""Golden Birthday"" or something similar.

Wait, but I need to think specifically about Assam. Assam has its own cultural traditions. I remember that in Assam, the traditional age for a significant celebration might be related to the age of 50. I think there's a term called ""Sorpati"" or ""Shasthi"" which refers to the 60th birthday, but maybe that's not the most grand. Alternatively, the ""Bihu"" festival is a major festival in Assam, but that's related to the agricultural cycle, not a specific age.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. There's a tradition called ""Sorpati"" which is the 60th birthday, and it's a significant event in Assam. However, I've also heard that the 50th birthday is considered a major milestone. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in some parts of India, the 60th birthday is considered a major event, but in Assam, perhaps the 50th is more grand. Alternatively, maybe the 100th birthday? That seems less likely.

Wait, I need to verify. Let me recall. The term ""Sorpati"" refers to the 60th year, and it's a traditional celebration in Assam. However, maybe the 50th birthday is more commonly celebrated, or perhaps the 60th. I think the 60th is considered a major age, so the answer might be 60. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the 50th is more grand. I need to be careful here. Let me try to think of any festivals or traditions. The Bihu is for new year, but not age-related. Maybe there's a specific term for 50. Alternatively, could it be the 100th? That seems less common. I think the most plausible answer is 60, as Sorpati is the 60th birthday and it's a significant event. So the",1,,

New-su-24,What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about sports that parents and children commonly play together in Assam. First, I need to recall what sports are popular in Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, so maybe they have traditional games or sports that are family-oriented.

I know that in many parts of India, games like cricket, football, and kabaddi are popular. But the question specifies parents and children playing together, so maybe more traditional or team sports that can be played by all ages. Also, considering the region's culture, there might be local games.

Wait, there's a game called ""Polo"" which is traditional in some parts of India, but I'm not sure if it's common in Assam. Another thought: ""Kabaddi"" is a contact sport that's played in teams, and it's popular in many states. Maybe it's played by families too. Also, ""Gilli Danda"" is a traditional Indian game, often played by children, but would parents join in? Maybe.

Then there's ""Kho Kho,"" another traditional sport. It's a tag game that requires teamwork. That could be something parents and kids do together. Also, maybe ""Volleyball"" or ""Badminton"" are common in schools and communities, so families might play those.

But I should verify if these are indeed common in Assam. Since I don't have specific data on Assam's family sports, I need to rely on general knowledge. However, the user wants the answer in a JSON list. Let me think again. Maybe ""Kabaddi"" and ""Kho Kho"" are more likely to be played by families. Also, ""Football"" (soccer) is very popular in India, so that's possible. Additionally, ""Cricket"" is a big sport, but maybe more for individual play. Traditional games like ""Gilli Danda"" and ""Pithu"" (a game with a stick and ball) might be played by children, but not sure about parents joining.

Alternatively, maybe ""Mauve"" or ""Dhopkhel"" (a type of stick game) are traditional in Assam. Wait, Dhopkhel is a traditional game of Assam, played with sticks. That might be a good answer. Also, ""Boule"" or ""Boules"" isn't specific to Assam. Maybe ""Ragby"" isn't common there. 

So",1,,
Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in Assam's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the required subjects for Assam's university entrance exams. Let me start by recalling what I know. Assam has several universities, like Gauhati University, which is one of the major ones. The entrance exams might vary depending on the university and the course the student is applying for.

For example, if someone is applying for a B.Sc. program, the entrance exam might test subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. For B.A., it might be subjects like English, History, and another language. But wait, the question is about the required subjects in the entrance exam, not the undergraduate courses. Hmm.

I should check if there's a common pattern across Assam's universities. Maybe the entrance exams for different courses have different subject requirements. But the user might be asking for the general subjects required for the entrance exams, not specific to each course. However, without specifying the course, it's hard to give a precise answer.

Alternatively, maybe the entrance exams in Assam, such as the Assam Common Entrance Test (ACET), have specific subjects. But I'm not sure if ACET exists. Let me think. Some universities in Assam conduct their own entrance exams. For instance, Gauhati University has its own entrance exams for various courses. The required subjects would depend on the program. For engineering, it's likely Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. For medical, perhaps Biology instead of Mathematics. For arts, it could be English and a language. 

But the user is asking for the required subjects in the entrance exam, not the courses. Maybe they are referring to the general subjects that are commonly tested. However, since different courses have different requirements, the answer might need to be general. But I need to confirm if there's a standard set of subjects for the entrance exams in Assam. 

Alternatively, maybe the entrance exams in Assam require candidates to have passed certain subjects in their 12th grade. For example, for science courses, Physics, Chemistry, and Math. For commerce, Commerce, Math, and English. For arts, English and a language. 

But the question is about the entrance exam's required subjects, not the eligibility criteria. So perhaps the entrance exams themselves test specific subjects. For example, the entrance exam for B.Sc. might have questions on Physics, Chemistry, and Math. For B.A., it might have English, History, and another subject. However, without specific information on the exam structure, I",1,,

Th-en-44,What is Assam's most popular food for family meals on weekends?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about Assam's most popular food for family meals on weekends. First, I need to recall what Assam is known for in terms of cuisine. Assam is a state in northeast India, and their food is typically rich in spices and uses a lot of local ingredients like bamboo shoots, fish, and herbs.

I remember that Assamese cuisine includes dishes like ""khar"" which is a saltwater dish, but that might be more of a daily dish. Then there's ""dal"" which is a lentil soup, but again, maybe not specific to weekends. Wait, there's also ""pitha"" which are rice cakes, often made during festivals or special occasions. But are they eaten on weekends?

Another possibility is ""chhola"" which is a type of spicy chickpea dish, but I'm not sure if that's the most popular. Maybe ""bhapa"" dishes, like bhapa dokra, which are steamed or boiled preparations. But again, not sure about the weekend context.

Wait, maybe the most popular family meal is ""Assamese thali"" which includes a variety of dishes like dal, rice, vegetables, and fish curry. However, the user is asking for a specific dish. Alternatively, ""kheer"" is a dessert, but that's not a main meal. 

Wait, perhaps ""Luchi"" with ""Aloo dum"" (spiced potatoes). But I think that's more of a Bengali dish. Hmm. Maybe ""Pitha"" is more accurate. Or ""Ghugni"", which is a dish made from cluster beans. 

Alternatively, ""Rasgulla"" is a sweet, but again, not a main course. Let me think again. Since weekends are for family gatherings, maybe a special dish is prepared. I think ""Assam's most popular food for family meals on weekends"" might be ""Pitha"" or ""Khar"". However, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe ""Fish curry with rice"" is a common dish, but is that specifically for weekends? 

Wait, I should verify. From what I've read before, Assamese cuisine has dishes like ""Khar"" (saltwater dish), ""Pitha"", ""Dhokha"" (a type of dumpling), and ""Bhapa"" (steamed dishes). For weekends, maybe the family prepares more elaborate meals, so perhaps ""Ass",1,,
Th-en-45,What is the most popular weekday evening family activity in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular weekday evening family activity is in Assam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its tea plantations, rivers, and rich cultural heritage. The people there have various traditions and daily routines.

Weekday evenings... Families might have activities that are both relaxing and culturally significant. Let me think about common activities. In many parts of India, evenings are often spent with family, maybe watching TV, having meals, or engaging in local traditions.

But what's specific to Assam? I know that Assamese culture has a strong connection with nature. Maybe they go for walks by the Brahmaputra River? Or perhaps they have some traditional games or gatherings. Another thought: Assam is known for its festivals, but those are usually on specific days. However, on regular weekdays, maybe they have family dinners or participate in local markets.

Wait, there's also the aspect of tea culture. Assam is famous for its tea, so maybe families gather to enjoy tea time in the evenings. But is that considered a family activity? Or maybe they visit local markets or shops in the evenings, which is a common practice.

Another angle: religious or cultural practices. Maybe attending evening prayers or cultural events. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular. Also, considering the climate, evenings might be cooler, so outdoor activities could be more common.

I've heard that in some regions, family games like carrom or chess are popular. But is that specific to Assam? Alternatively, maybe they have evening walks or picnics in parks. Or maybe watching local sports events?

Wait, I should check if there's any specific information. But since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on existing knowledge. Another thought: Assam has a lot of greenery and natural beauty, so family outings in nature might be common. However, I'm not certain if that's the most popular.

Alternatively, maybe family meals together. In many cultures, having dinner as a family is a key activity. But the question specifies a ""family activity,"" which might be more than just eating. Maybe they have cultural storytelling or music sessions.

Wait, but the answer needs to be the most popular. If I have to pick one, considering the tea culture and the social aspect, perhaps having tea together in the evening is a common family activity. Or maybe visiting local markets or shopping in the evenings",1,,
New-ch-44,"How long is the typical probation period for new employees before signing a formal contract in Assam? (e.g., 1 month).","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the typical probation period for new employees in Assam before signing a formal contract. Let me think about this.

First, I know that probation periods can vary by country and even by region within a country. In India, labor laws are governed by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and other state-specific regulations. However, Assam is a state in India, so I should check if there are any specific state laws there.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about Assam's specific regulations. The general rule in India is that the probation period can be up to 6 months, but it's often shorter, like 3 to 6 months. However, this might depend on the type of employment and the terms agreed upon between the employer and employee. 

But the user is specifically asking about Assam. I need to confirm if Assam has any different standards. Maybe looking into the Assam Labour Act or any amendments. However, I might not have the exact details. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no specific state law, and it's governed by the general Indian labor laws. But I should be careful not to assume.

Another angle: Companies in Assam might follow the same norms as other parts of India, which are typically 3 to 6 months. However, some companies might have shorter periods, like 1-2 months. But the user's example was 1 month, but that's just an example. 

Wait, the user provided an example with ""1 month"" but wants the actual answer. So, I need to check if the standard in Assam is different. If there's no specific state law, then the answer would be that it's not mandated by state law and varies by employer, but typically 3-6 months as per general Indian practice. However, maybe in Assam, it's different. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no fixed probation period mandated by law in Assam, and it's determined by the employer and employee agreement. But the user might expect a standard duration. 

Hmm, I think I should state that there's no specific legal mandate for probation periods in Assam, and it's usually agreed upon between the employer and employee, typically ranging from 1 to 6 months. However, I need to be accurate. 

Wait, the Indian Industrial Disputes Act allows for a probation period of up to 6 months, but it's not mandatory",1,,
New-in-62,What university in Assam is popular because of its engineering major? (Provide the official name.),"<think>
Okay, so I need to find out which university in Assam is known for its engineering programs. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India. I remember there are a few universities there, like Gauhati University. Wait, but is Gauhati University known specifically for engineering? Or maybe there's another one.

Wait, I think there's an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Guwahati. Oh, right! IIT Guwahati is a prestigious engineering institution. But the question specifies a university in Assam. Now, IITs are autonomous institutions, but they are often referred to as universities. However, sometimes people might confuse them with regular state universities. Let me confirm if IIT Guwahati is considered a university. Yes, it is a deemed university, so it's recognized as a university. 

Alternatively, there's also the Assam University, but I think that's more focused on other disciplines. Then there's the Rajiv Gandhi University, but again, not sure about engineering. Another possibility is the Tezpur University, but that's in Tezpur, which is in Assam. However, I'm not sure if Tezpur University is more renowned for engineering compared to IIT Guwahati. 

Wait, IIT Guwahati is definitely one of the top engineering institutes in India. It's part of the IIT system, which is known for excellence in engineering education. So even though it's an IIT, it's located in Assam and is a university. The official name would be Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. But maybe the question is looking for a state university? However, given the prominence of IIT Guwahati in engineering, that's likely the answer. Let me check if there are other engineering universities in Assam. 

Another thought: there's the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology (NERIST), which is in Arunachal Pradesh, not Assam. So that's not it. Then there's the Assam Engineering College, but that's a college, not a university. So the main university-level institution in Assam with a strong engineering program is IIT Guwahati. 

Therefore, the answer should be the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. The official name is ""Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati."" I need to confirm that it's located in Ass",1,,

Tmp-ar-01,Where do university students in Assam usually go to study for their final exams?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking where university students in Assam usually go to study for their final exams. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India. It has several universities, both public and private. The main ones include Gauhati University, which is one of the oldest and most prominent. Then there's Assam University, which is also a significant institution. There might be other universities like Dibrugarh University, Tezpur University, and some private institutions like Brahmaputra University or others.

Now, the question is about where students go to study for their final exams. Typically, students might study in libraries, their hostels, or at home. But the question is about the usual places. However, the answer might be referring to the universities themselves. But wait, the question is phrased as ""go to study,"" which could mean the physical locations they go to prepare. However, maybe the user is asking about the institutions where they take their final exams. That's a bit ambiguous. 

Wait, the question is about where they go to study for their final exams. So it's about preparation, not the location of the exams. But in that case, the answer would be places like libraries, study centers, or their own rooms. However, the user might be expecting the names of the universities. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that they study in their respective university campuses, like Gauhati University, Assam University, etc.

But I need to check if there's a common answer to this. Maybe the answer is the universities themselves. Since the user wants a list of places, perhaps the major universities in Assam. Let me think again. If the question is about where they go to study (as in prepare), then the answer could be libraries, study groups, or their own accommodations. But if the question is about where they take the exams, then it's the university examination centers. However, the wording is ""study for their final exams,"" which implies preparation. But the user might have a different intention.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that they study in their respective university campuses. For example, students at Gauhati University would study on campus, same with Assam University. But that seems too generic. However, the user might be looking for specific institutions. Let me verify. 

Looking up, Assam has several universities, and students usually study on their respective",1,,
Ne-ar-38,Which food do people usually offer as charity in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which food is usually offered as charity in Assam. First, I need to recall or find out about traditional foods in Assam that are commonly used for charitable purposes.

Assam is a state in India known for its diverse culture and cuisine. The food there often includes rice, fish, and various vegetables. Now, when it comes to charity, maybe there's a specific dish that's traditionally given. I remember that in some regions, specific dishes are associated with festivals or religious practices. For example, in Assam, there's a dish called ""pitha"" which is a type of rice cake. But wait, is that used for charity?

Alternatively, ""khichdi"" is a common dish in many parts of India, made with rice and lentils, and it's often given as alms. But I'm not sure if that's specific to Assam. Another possibility is ""dal"" (lentils) with rice, which is a staple. However, the user is asking for a specific food that's usually offered as charity.

Wait, I think in Assam, ""pitha"" is made during festivals, but maybe not specifically for charity. Another thought: ""muri"" is a puffed rice dish, but again, not sure about charity. Maybe ""bhapa"" dishes like bhapa doru (steamed fish with eggplant), but that's more of a regular meal.

Alternatively, ""chhola"" (chickpea curry) is popular in Assam. However, I need to confirm if there's a specific dish associated with charity. Maybe the answer is ""khichdi"" as it's a common alms food across India, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps ""aam pitha"" (mango pitha) is given during certain times, but again, not sure about charity.

Wait, maybe the answer is ""khichdi"" because it's a simple, staple food that's commonly given as charity. However, I need to make sure. Let me think again. In some regions, ""pitha"" is given as offerings, but in Assam, during certain festivals, they might offer specific dishes. However, the question is about charity in general, not just festivals.

Alternatively, maybe ""dal"" is the answer. But I need to check if there's a specific dish. Since I can't look it up right now, I'll go with",1,,
Jod-ch-01,What eating utensils do people commonly used in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the eating utensils commonly used in Assam. First, I need to recall what I know about Assam's culture and cuisine. Assam is a state in东北印度, known for its diverse ethnic groups and traditional food. The cuisine there includes dishes like bamboo shoot curry, fermented foods, and various rice-based dishes.

Now, thinking about utensils. In many parts of India, people use items like spoons, forks, and sometimes hands. But Assam might have specific traditional utensils. I remember that in some regions, people use a ""khuli"" or a wooden spoon, but I'm not sure if that's specific to Assam. Also, there's the ""chutney"" or ""chutni"" which is a type of dip, but that's a food item, not a utensil.

Wait, maybe the ""tiffin"" or ""thali"" is used? Thalis are common in many parts of India for serving food. But I need to confirm if that's specific to Assam. Alternatively, considering the local materials, maybe they use bamboo utensils? Or perhaps the ""katori"" which is a small bowl used for eating with hands.

Another angle: in Assam, meals are often eaten with hands, especially when it comes to rice and curry. So maybe the primary utensil is the hand, but they might also use a small spoon or a piece of bread to scoop food. However, the question asks for utensils, which typically refers to tools used for eating. So if they use hands, that's a method, but not a utensil per se.

Wait, maybe the ""dabba"" or ""tiffin box"" is used for carrying food, but that's a container, not an eating utensil. Alternatively, the ""chopsticks"" – but I don't think that's common in Assam. More likely, they use a spoon or a fork. However, I'm not certain if there's a specific traditional utensil unique to Assam. Maybe the ""khuli"" is used, but I need to verify.

Alternatively, considering the local dishes, which are often had with rice, they might use a spoon for soups or curries, and hands for rice. But the answer might just be a general list of common utensils used in India, like spoon, fork, and hand. However, the question specifies Assam, so I need to be precise.

After checking some",1,,
New-gr-08,What type of alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Assam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its tea plantations, but also for its tribal communities and cultural festivals.

I remember that in many parts of India, especially in states with significant tribal populations, traditional or local alcoholic drinks are popular during festivals. For example, in some regions, they might have things like toddy, which is a fermented sap from palm trees. But I need to be specific about Assam.

Wait, Assam has several tribes like the Bodos, Dimasas, and others. I think they have their own traditional drinks. Maybe something like ""Chang"" or ""Laa"" or ""Luhri""? I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Chang is a type of fermented drink, often made from rice or other grains. It's a local liquor in some parts of Assam and neighboring regions. Also, there's ""Pachari"" which is a type of rice beer. But I need to confirm which one is most commonly consumed at festivals.

Another angle: Assam's festivals, like Bihu, are major events. During Bihu, people might consume local alcoholic beverages. I've heard that ""Laa"" is a traditional Assamese drink, made from fermented rice. Wait, but I should check if that's accurate. Alternatively, ""Dhokha"" is a type of rice beer, but I'm not sure about its popularity in festivals.

Wait, maybe the most common one is ""Chang."" I think Chang is a traditional drink among the Bodo people. It's made from fermented rice or millet. Since festivals in Assam often involve tribal communities, and Chang is a local liquor, it's possible that's the answer. But I need to make sure there isn't another drink that's more widely consumed. Alternatively, maybe ""Luhri"" which is a type of rice beer, but I'm not certain.

I should also consider that in some areas, people might consume commercially available drinks, but the question is about the most commonly consumed, which might be traditional. Given that, I think the answer is Chang. But I need to be careful. Let me think again: Assam's traditional alcoholic drinks include ""Chang,"" ""Laa,"" ""Luhri,"" and ""Pachari."" Among these, which is most associated with festivals",1,,

Ni-en-40,What is the most popular Christmas song in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most popular Christmas song in Assam. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall if there are any well-known Christmas songs specifically from Assam. Assam is a state in India, and while Christmas is celebrated there, especially in cities like Guwahati, the music scene might have local influences.

I know that in India, Christmas songs are often in English or Hindi, but maybe Assam has some local renditions. However, I'm not sure if there's a specific song that's universally recognized as the most popular. Maybe there's a traditional Assamese song that's adapted for Christmas? Or perhaps a song that's popular in Assamese culture during the holiday season.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized Christmas song unique to Assam, and people there might prefer mainstream Christmas songs like ""Jingle Bells"" or ""White Christmas,"" but in Assamese language. However, I don't have concrete information on that. 

I should check if any Assamese artists have released popular Christmas songs. But since I can't browse the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I remember, there might not be a single song that's considered the most popular. It's possible that the answer is that there isn't a specific song, but the user might expect a song title. Alternatively, maybe ""Bhagat Phul"" or ""Chhaya"" are Assamese songs that are sometimes associated with festivals, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, ""Bhagat Phul"" is a traditional Assamese song, but it's more of a love song. Maybe during Christmas, people sing it as part of celebrations? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a song like ""Christmas in Assam"" or something similar, but I don't recall it. 

Since I don't have specific data, the safest answer is that there isn't a widely recognized most popular Christmas song in Assam, but given the user expects an answer, perhaps the best approach is to state that there isn't a specific one, or maybe mention a commonly adapted song. However, without concrete information, the answer might be that there's no single song, but the user wants a list. So maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific song, but since the user requires an answer, perhaps the most popular is a traditional Assamese song that's adapted for Christmas. But",1,,

Traditional dishes include dishes like ""Khar"" (a salt and water solution), ""Pitha"" (rice cakes), and ""Dhokha"" (a type of noodle). But the question is about what's popular among young people now.

Young people might prefer modern or trendy foods. Maybe fast food or street food? Or perhaps fusion dishes that combine traditional Assamese elements with contemporary styles. I should consider if there's any specific dish that's gained popularity recently among the youth.

I remember that in many Indian states, items like momos (dumplings), burgers, and pizzas are popular among the youth. However, Assam might have its own versions. For example, ""Assamese momos"" are a local variant. Alternatively, ""Chutney"" or ""Pitha"" might be traditional but not necessarily the most popular among young people.

Wait, there's also ""Bamboo shoot curry"" which is traditional, but maybe not as trendy. Another thought: ""Litti"" or ""Kachori"" are popular in other regions, but are they in Assam? Or maybe ""Papaya shoot"" dishes?

I should check if there's any recent trend. Maybe street food like ""Dhokha"" with different toppings, or ""Pitha"" with modern twists. Alternatively, the popularity of tea in Assam might influence food, but that's more of a drink.

Alternatively, maybe ""Pork"" dishes are popular, like ""Pork rotti"" or ""Pork curry."" But I'm not sure if that's specifically among the youth.

Wait, I think ""Assam's youth might be into street food like ""Pani Puri"" or ""Bhel Puri,"" but those are more common in other parts of India. Maybe ""Vada Pav"" or ""Biryani"" is popular, but again, not sure about Assam specifically.

Alternatively, maybe ""Dhokla"" is a possibility, but that's more from Gujarat. Hmm.

I need to be careful here. Since I don't have specific data, I should rely on what's commonly known. The most popular traditional food in Assam is ""Dh",1,,

New-pe-76,What is a popular activity to do in parks in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about a popular activity in parks in Assam. First, I need to recall what Assam is known for. Assam is a state in India, known for its tea plantations, biodiversity, and rivers like the Brahmaputra. Now, parks in Assam... Maybe they have activities related to nature, like bird watching or hiking? Or perhaps something cultural?

Wait, Assam has several wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, such as Kaziranga National Park. But the question is about parks in general, not necessarily wildlife parks. However, even in urban parks, people might engage in activities like jogging, picnics, or cycling. But the user is asking for a popular activity specifically in Assam's parks.

Another angle: Assam has a rich cultural heritage. Maybe traditional games or festivals? But festivals are events, not activities in parks. Alternatively, boating on rivers or lakes within parks? Or maybe visiting temples located in parks?

Wait, there's the Kamakhya Temple, but that's a religious site. Maybe the parks in Assam are more about nature and outdoor activities. Bird watching could be a possibility since Assam is a biodiversity hotspot. Also, the state has several bird sanctuaries and parks where people might go for bird watching.

Alternatively, trekking or nature walks. But I need to confirm if that's a popular activity. Another thought: Assam is known for its tea gardens, so maybe visiting tea plantations is an activity, but that's more of a touristic activity rather than a park activity.

Wait, the question specifies ""parks,"" so maybe urban parks. In cities like Guwahati, there are parks like Digha Park or Jawaharlal Nehru Park. In such parks, common activities could be jogging, walking, playing sports, or having picnics. But is there a specific activity that's popular?

Alternatively, maybe cultural activities like folk dance performances or music, but that might be more in cultural centers. Hmm. I need to make sure. Since the user wants one single answer in a list, perhaps the most common activity would be something like ""bird watching"" given the natural environment, or ""nature walks."" Alternatively, if there's a specific festival-related activity, but that's seasonal.

Another angle: Assam's parks might have boating facilities. For example, in parks near rivers or lakes, boating could be a popular activity. Or maybe visiting the",1,,

Na-ko-39,What is typically given as a congratulatory gesture when attending a friend's wedding in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about a congratulatory gesture given at a friend's wedding in Assam. I need to figure out what that is. First, I should recall if there are any specific traditions in Assam related to weddings.

Assam is a state in northeastern India, and their culture is quite distinct. I know that in many Indian weddings, money or gifts are common, but maybe there's something more specific to Assam. I remember hearing about ""Dowry"" in Indian weddings, but that's more about the bride's family giving things to the groom's family. However, the question is about a gesture from attendees, not the families involved.

Wait, maybe it's about a specific gift or item. In some regions, people give gifts like jewelry, clothing, or household items. But for Assam, perhaps there's a traditional item. Alternatively, maybe it's a monetary gift, like a cash gift or ""Shagun."" But I need to be precise.

Another angle: in some parts of India, especially in Assam, people might give ""Ghanta"" (a bell) or ""Sona"" (gold) as a gift. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a traditional dress or something else. Wait, I should check if there's a specific item. Alternatively, maybe it's about giving a ""Wedding Gift"" in the form of money, but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, in Assam, there's a tradition called ""Phulam"" which is a flower garland, but that's more for the bride. Or maybe ""Chameli"" which is a type of flower. But I'm not certain. Another thought: in some Assamese weddings, guests might give money in a specific way, like in a red envelope, similar to Chinese tradition, but that's a guess.

Wait, I think the common practice in many parts of India, including Assam, is giving a monetary gift, often in a decorative envelope. However, I need to make sure that this is specific to Assam. Alternatively, maybe there's a traditional item like a ""Dhokra"" (a type of metal craft) or something else. But I'm not sure. Since I can't look it up, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

Considering that the user wants a single answer, and given that in many Indian regions, including Assam, guests typically give money as a congratulatory gesture,",1,,

Al-en-32,What is the main dish for Thanksgiving in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the main dish for Thanksgiving in Assam. First, I need to recall what Thanksgiving is. It's a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada, primarily in November, where people give thanks for the harvest. The traditional main dish there is usually turkey.

But wait, the question is about Assam. Assam is a state in India, known for its diverse culture and cuisine. Now, does Assam have a Thanksgiving celebration? I'm not sure. Thanksgiving is not a traditional Indian holiday. However, maybe there are some communities in Assam that have adopted the tradition, perhaps due to cultural exchange or influence from other regions. Alternatively, the user might be confusing Thanksgiving with another local festival in Assam, like Bihu or another harvest festival.

Assuming that the user is referring to a Thanksgiving celebration in Assam, perhaps by expatriates or in a multicultural setting, the main dish might still be turkey. But I should verify if there's a local dish that's more commonly associated with any harvest celebrations in Assam. For example, Assamese cuisine includes dishes like fish curry, bamboo shoot preparations, and pitha (a type of sweet). However, these are more related to local festivals like Bihu, not Thanksgiving.

Alternatively, if the question is based on a misunderstanding, maybe the user is asking about a local dish in Assam that's served during a harvest time, but the term ""Thanksgiving"" is being used incorrectly. In that case, the answer might be a local dish like ""muri"" (puffed rice) or ""dal"" (lentil soup), but I need to be careful here.

But the question specifically mentions Thanksgiving, so unless there's a specific event in Assam called Thanksgiving, which I'm not aware of, the answer should probably state that Thanksgiving is not a traditional Assamese holiday, and thus there isn't a specific main dish associated with it. However, if the user is asking hypothetically, assuming that Thanksgiving is celebrated there, the main dish would likely be turkey as in the US, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different holiday. But given the information, the safest answer is that Thanksgiving is not traditionally celebrated in Assam, so there's no specific main dish. However, if they are looking for a local dish that might be served during a similar harvest celebration, it's possible that dishes like ""bhapa til"" (roasted sesame seeds",1,,

An-ar-03,Which month is the final exam term usually scheduled at high schools in Assam? (Provide Arabic numerals (1~12) only.),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which month high schools in Assam usually schedule their final exams. Let me start by recalling what I know about the education system in Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, and like most Indian states, schools follow either the CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) or state-specific syllabi. However, the academic calendar might vary slightly based on regional requirements.

In India, the academic year typically starts in April or June, depending on the board. For example, CBSE schools usually start in April, with the academic year running from April to March. However, state boards might have different schedules. But wait, Assam has its own state board, so maybe their exam dates are different from CBSE.

I remember that in many states, the final exams for high school (which is usually class 10 or 12) are held in March or April. However, if the academic year starts in April, the exams might be in March of the following year. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again.

If the academic year starts in April, then the final exams would be at the end of the academic year, which would be March. For example, if the year starts in April 2023, then the exams would be in March 2024. But in some states, the academic year might start in June, leading to exams in May or June. However, I think in Assam, the schools might follow the state's academic calendar.

Looking up in my mind, I recall that in Assam, the school year might start in June, and the final exams are usually in March. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me try to break it down. If the academic year starts in June, then the year would end in May, but exams might be in March? That doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe the school year starts in April, leading to exams in March. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the final exams for high schools in Assam are in the month of March. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in India, many state boards conduct their final exams in March. For example, the West Bengal Board exams are in March. Since Assam is in the northeast, maybe they follow a similar schedule. So, if the academic year starts in April, the exams would be in March. So the answer would be 3 (March). But I need to",1,,
Ji-ko-28,When is the first day that people celebrate after a child is born in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the first day people celebrate after a child is born in Assam. Hmm, Assam is a state in India, right? I need to recall or figure out the cultural practices there regarding newborn celebrations.

First, I know that in many Indian cultures, there are specific rituals after a child's birth. For example, in some regions, there's a naming ceremony or a similar event. But I'm not sure about Assam specifically. Let me think. Assam has its own ethnic groups like the Bodos, Assamese, and others. Maybe there's a particular festival or ceremony unique to the region.

Wait, I remember something about the ""Bihu"" festivals in Assam. Bihu is a major festival celebrated by the Assamese people, marking the Assamese New Year. There are different types of Bihu, like Rongali Bihu, which is the most famous, celebrated around April. But how does that relate to a newborn?

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific ceremony called ""Namkaran"" which is a naming ceremony. In some cultures, the naming ceremony happens on the 11th day after birth, but I'm not sure about Assam. Or perhaps it's a different day. Let me check my memory. 

Wait, I think in Assam, the first celebration after a child's birth is called ""Bor Bihu"" or maybe ""Shonit Bihu."" No, that might be related to the harvest. Alternatively, maybe the ""Kati Bihu"" which is celebrated on the 1st day of the month of Kati. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the first day of celebration is the same as the birth day, but the question says ""the first day that people celebrate after a child is born,"" which might mean the first day following the birth. However, sometimes the celebration might be on the same day. 

Wait, I think in Assam, there's a tradition called ""Shonit Bihu"" which is a festival of blood, but that's related to a different context. Maybe I'm mixing up different festivals. Alternatively, perhaps the first celebration is the ""Namkaran"" ceremony, which is the naming ceremony. But when is that held? 

I think in some parts of India, like in North India, the naming ceremony is on the 11th day, but in Assam, maybe it's different. Alternatively,",1,,
Na-ko-33,What symbolic food do people from Assam eat on (Lunar) New Year?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the symbolic food eaten by people from Assam during Lunar New Year. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assamese New Year, which is called ""Bihu."" There are different types of Bihu, like Rongali Bihu, which is the most popular and celebrated in April. However, the Lunar New Year might be a bit different. Wait, Assam primarily follows the solar calendar for Bihu, but maybe there's a lunar aspect I'm not considering.

I need to check if Assam has a Lunar New Year celebration. Wait, the Lunar New Year is more commonly associated with Chinese New Year, but in Assam, the main New Year is the Assamese New Year, which is based on the solar calendar. However, the user specifically mentioned (Lunar) New Year, so maybe they are referring to a different event or perhaps a mix-up. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the Assamese New Year, which is sometimes called Bihu, and the user mistakenly referred to it as Lunar New Year.

Assuming the user is referring to the Assamese New Year (Bihu), the traditional foods include ""Pitha"" and ""Laru."" Pitha is a type of rice cake, and Laru is a sweet made from wheat flour. These are prepared during the Bihu festival. However, the user mentioned Lunar New Year. If they are indeed referring to the Lunar New Year, which is not traditionally celebrated in Assam, the answer might be different. But since Assam's New Year is solar-based, perhaps the user is conflating terms. Alternatively, maybe in some communities in Assam, there's a lunar-based celebration.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the ""Bihu"" as a lunar event. Let me verify. The Assamese New Year, Rongali Bihu, is celebrated on the first day of the Assamese month Bohag, which is around April 14-15, and it's based on the solar calendar. However, there's also ""Kati Bihu"" in October and ""Bhogali Bihu"" in January. The Bhogali Bihu is sometimes associated with the end of the harvest season and might involve different foods. But I'm not sure if that's lunar-based.

Alternatively, maybe the user is asking about the Chinese Lunar New Year, but in Assam. However, the Chinese New Year is not a traditional Assames",1,,

New-su-42,What religion is mainly taught in schools in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what religion is mainly taught in schools in Assam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its diverse population. The primary religions in Assam include Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and various tribal religions. However, the question is about what religion is mainly taught in schools there.

First, I need to consider the education system in India. In general, the Indian education system is secular, meaning it doesn't promote any particular religion. However, there might be some religious education included, especially in certain contexts. For example, some schools might offer religious studies as part of their curriculum, but this can vary by region and school type.

In Assam, the majority of the population is Hindu, followed by Muslims and Christians. But does that mean Hinduism is the main religion taught in schools? Or is the education system more focused on secular subjects without emphasizing any specific religion?

Wait, there's also the aspect of the syllabus. In many Indian states, schools might include topics related to local culture, history, and traditions, which could involve religious practices. However, formal religious instruction might not be a primary focus unless it's a religious school. For example, in some states, there are schools affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or state boards, which have a standardized curriculum that's secular.

Another angle is the presence of minority schools. In Assam, there are Christian missionary schools, which might teach Christianity. Similarly, there could be Muslim schools teaching Islamic studies. However, the question is about the ""mainly"" taught religion, which might refer to the most common or dominant one in the curriculum across the state.

But I need to be careful here. In India, the constitution doesn't require religious education in schools, but some schools might include it. However, the majority of schools in Assam, especially government-run ones, might focus on secular education. However, the state's cultural context might influence the inclusion of local religious practices or history in the curriculum. For instance, there might be lessons on the history of Assam, which includes various religious influences, but not necessarily promoting a specific religion.

Alternatively, perhaps the main religion taught isn't a specific one but rather secular values. However, the user is asking for the main religion, so maybe the answer is that no single religion is mainly taught, but the education system is secular. However, the question might be expecting a specific answer",1,,
Ne-ar-06,What do people from Assam eat in Ramadan?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about what people from Assam eat during Ramadan. First, I need to recall if Assam has any specific foods associated with Ramadan. Assam is a state in India with a diverse culture, including various communities like Muslims, Hindus, and others. Ramadan is a Muslim observance, so I should focus on the dietary habits of Muslim communities in Assam during this month.

I know that during Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. The main meals would be Iftar (the evening meal breaking the fast) and Suhoor (the pre-dawn meal). Now, what are the typical dishes in Assam? Assamese cuisine includes items like pitha (a type of sweet or savory pancake), lokhi (a kind of eggplant curry), and various fish dishes since Assam is near rivers and has a lot of fish. Also, there's a lot of use of mustard oil and spices like turmeric, green chilies, and ginger.

But I need to check if there are specific dishes that are more commonly consumed during Ramadan. Maybe they prepare traditional sweets for Iftar, like mishti doi (sweet yogurt) or kheer. Also, during fasting, they might have more fruits, dates, and nuts for Suhoor. However, I'm not entirely sure if there are Assamese-specific dishes that are unique to Ramadan. It's possible that they follow similar practices to other Muslim communities in India but with local ingredients.

Wait, maybe they have a dish called ""pitha"" which is made during festivals. But is that specific to Ramadan? Or is it more of a general festival food? Also, ""lokhi"" and ""dal"" (lentils) are common in Assamese meals. For Iftar, they might have more substantial meals with meat or fish. However, I should make sure not to assume and stick to what's commonly known.

Another thought: In many parts of India, during Ramadan, people might prepare dishes like biryani, kebabs, or samosas for Iftar. But in Assam, they might have their own versions. However, I'm not certain if these are specific to Assam or just general Indian practices. Since the user is asking about Assam specifically, I should focus on local dishes.

So, compiling this, the answer would include traditional Assamese dishes that are consumed during Ramadan, such as pitha, lokhi, fish curry, and maybe some sweets like",1,,

Al-en-39,What do people eat on their birthday in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people eat on their birthday in Assam. First, I should recall if I know anything about Assamese cuisine or birthday traditions there. Assam is a state in India, known for its diverse culture and food. Their cuisine includes dishes like rice, fish, and various curries.

But specifically for birthdays, maybe there are traditional dishes they prepare. I remember that in many parts of India, sweets are a common part of celebrations. Maybe Assam has its own sweets. Also, they might have specific dishes that are eaten during festivals or special occasions.

I should check if there are any unique foods associated with Assamese birthdays. For example, in some regions, people might make special cakes or desserts. However, Assam might have its own version. I think they have a dish called ""pitha,"" which are rice cakes, often made during festivals. Maybe that's part of birthday meals too.

Also, considering the local ingredients, Assam uses a lot of bamboo shoots, fish, and spices. Perhaps they prepare a special fish curry or a dish with bamboo shoots for birthdays. Another possibility is ""bhapa"" dishes, which are steamed or boiled fish. But I'm not entirely sure if these are specifically for birthdays.

I should also think about any regional variations. Maybe the answer includes both traditional dishes and common celebratory foods. Since the question is about what people eat, not just traditional, maybe they have a mix of local and general birthday foods like cake, but with Assamese twists.

Wait, the user is asking for a list of what they eat, so I need to list specific dishes. If I'm not certain, maybe I should list the most probable ones. Pitha, maybe a type of cake or sweet, and also dishes like ""chhola"" (a lentil dish) or ""dal"" (lentils) with rice. But I'm not sure if these are specific to birthdays.

Alternatively, maybe the answer includes both the traditional sweets and the main course dishes. So possible answers could be: pitha, laru (a sweet made from rice flour and jaggery), and maybe a special fish curry. Also, maybe they serve a dessert called ""kheer"" which is a rice pudding, but that's common across India.

I need to make sure I'm not confusing Assamese dishes with other Indian regions. Let me try to recall: Assamese cuisine does have pithas,",1,,
Ne-ar-26,What is the most famous public corporation in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most famous public corporation in Assam. Let me start by recalling what a public corporation is. It's a company that is owned by the government, right? So, in Assam, which is a state in India, I need to think about government-owned companies that are well-known.

First, I remember that Assam has some key industries like tea, oil, and maybe some infrastructure projects. The Assam government might have corporations in these sectors. The Assam Tea Company comes to mind because Assam is famous for its tea plantations. But wait, is that a public corporation? Or is it a private company?

Then there's the Assam Oil Company. I think that's a public sector undertaking. Also, the Assam State Electricity Board might be another one, but I'm not sure if it's still active. There's also the Assam Transport Corporation, which handles transport services within the state. Which of these is the most famous?

The Assam Tea Company, or maybe the Assam Tea Board? Wait, the Tea Board of India is a national body, but Assam has its own tea industry. Alternatively, the Indian Oil Corporation has a presence in Assam, but that's a national company, not specific to Assam. 

Wait, the Assam State Electricity Board was restructured into the Assam Power Generation Corporation (APGENCO) and Assam Power Distribution Company Limited (APDCL). Are those considered public corporations? But the question is about the most famous one. 

Alternatively, the Assam Transport Corporation (ATC) is a well-known public transport company in the state, providing bus services. But is that the most famous? Maybe not as much as the tea industry. 

Another possibility is the Assam Cooperative Apex Bank, but that's a bank. The Assam State Co-operative Bank might be more prominent. However, I'm not certain. 

Wait, I think the Assam Tea Company Limited (ATCL) is a public corporation. It's one of the largest tea producers in Assam. But I should verify if it's government-owned. Alternatively, the India Tea Association is a trade body, not a corporation. 

Alternatively, the Assam State Road Transport Corporation (ASRTC) is a public transport company. But again, which one is the most famous? 

I think the most likely answer is the Assam Tea Company Limited, as Assam is renowned for its tea, and the government might have a",1,,
Ji-ko-36,Which subject’s academy/private educational institute do middle or high students most frequently attend in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Assam attend most frequently. First, I need to think about the common subjects that students might need extra help with. In many regions, subjects like math and science are often areas where students seek tutoring because they can be challenging.

Assam is a state in India, and the education system there follows the Indian curriculum. For middle and high school, subjects like Mathematics, Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), and English are typically core subjects. However, in some cases, students might also need help with languages like Assamese or other regional languages, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Now, considering private institutes and academies, they often focus on subjects that are critical for exams like the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams. These exams are important for students' futures, so subjects that are part of these exams would be in demand. 

In many parts of India, coaching institutes for competitive exams like JEE (for engineering) or NEET (for medical) are popular, but those are usually for higher secondary students. However, the question is about middle or high school students, which might be more around grades 6-10 or 8-12, depending on the region. If it's middle school (like grades 6-8), then the focus might be more on building a strong foundation in core subjects. 

Another angle: in Assam, there might be a particular emphasis on certain subjects due to cultural or economic factors. For example, English is often considered important for higher education and jobs. However, if students are struggling with English, they might take institutes focusing on that. But I'm not certain about that in Assam specifically.

Alternatively, math tutoring is common globally, so maybe that's the case here. Also, considering that in many cases, students might take private tuition for subjects they find difficult, and math is a common one. 

I should also check if there are any specific trends in Assam. For instance, if there's a high demand for science subjects because of career opportunities, or maybe language subjects. But without specific data, I have to rely on general trends.

Putting it all together, the most frequent subjects would likely be Mathematics and Science, followed by English. However, the question asks for the most frequently attended. If I have to choose one, maybe Mathematics is the most common because",1,,

Ji-ko-37,What type of clothing do middle and high school students wear to school in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what clothing middle and high school students in Assam wear to school. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. It's a state in northeastern India, known for its diverse cultures and traditions. The climate there is tropical, so it's probably hot and humid, which would influence their clothing.

First, I should consider the typical school uniforms in India. Many schools have a standard uniform, which might include a shirt, trousers, and a blazer or a dress. But since Assam has its own cultural aspects, there might be some local variations. For example, maybe they incorporate traditional attire into the uniforms, like the Mekhela Chador for girls, which is a traditional Assamese dress. However, school uniforms might be more standardized to maintain a uniform look, so maybe they have a blend of traditional elements with standard school wear.

Also, considering the weather, light and breathable fabrics would be common. So cotton or linen clothes might be preferred. For boys, perhaps a shirt and trousers, maybe a sweater during cooler months, but since Assam can be hot, maybe not. Girls might wear skirts or salwar kameez. But I need to check if there's a specific uniform mandated by schools in Assam.

Wait, but the question is about what they actually wear, not just the uniform. However, in many schools, uniforms are compulsory. So the answer would likely be based on the standard school uniforms. I should also consider if there are any religious or cultural influences. For instance, some students might wear traditional attire even if it's not part of the uniform.

Another thought: in some parts of India, schools require specific colors or styles. Maybe in Assam, the uniforms are similar to other states but with local touches. For example, the blazer might have a specific color, or the shirt might be a certain style. Also, during festivals or cultural events, students might wear traditional clothes, but that's not daily wear.

I should also think about any regional variations within Assam. Different ethnic groups might have different traditional clothes, but school uniforms are usually standardized across the state. So the answer would probably be a standard school uniform with possible local elements, like the Mekhela Chador for girls or a specific type of shirt for boys.

Wait, but maybe the answer is more general. If I can't find specific information, the safest answer is that they wear standard school uniforms, which typically include shirts, trousers, skirts,",1,,
Ca-sp-41,Where do the dependent elderly usually live in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking where dependent elderly people usually live in Assam. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall what I know about Assam's demographics and social structures.

Assam is a state in northeastern India. I know that in many parts of India, elderly people might live with their families, especially in rural areas. But there could be differences based on cultural practices. In Assam, there's a significant population of indigenous tribes, like the Bodos, Assamese, and others. Some communities might have traditional practices where elderly are cared for within the family.

However, with urbanization and changing social dynamics, maybe some elderly move to cities for better healthcare or to be near their children. But the question is about where they ""usually"" live. So, I should consider the majority case.

I should also think about any specific institutions or homes for the elderly in Assam. Are there government or NGO-run homes? But the question is about where they usually live, which might imply their primary residence rather than institutional care. Unless the majority are in such homes, which I don't think is the case.

Another angle: in rural Assam, extended families are common. So elderly might live with their children or in joint families. In urban areas, maybe nuclear families are more common, but still, elderly might live with their children. However, if the children are working in cities, perhaps the elderly stay in their villages. But the question is about where they usually live, so maybe the answer is with their families, both in rural and urban areas. But I need to check if there's a specific trend in Assam.

Wait, I should also consider if there are any cultural reasons for elderly living separately. For example, in some cultures, elderly live in separate houses but nearby. But I think in Assam, the norm is still family-based care. So the answer would be that dependent elderly usually live with their families, either in rural or urban areas of Assam. But I need to confirm if there's any other common living arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe some elderly live in care homes, especially if they are dependent and their families can't care for them. But I'm not sure if that's the majority. The question says ""usually,"" so the most common scenario. I think family homes are the usual place. So the answer would be that dependent elderly in Assam usually live with their families, either in rural or urban areas. But the user wants a single answer in",1,,
Sa-en-31,What is Assam's most popular family pet?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular family pet in Assam is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeast India, known for its tea plantations, biodiversity, and indigenous communities. The culture there is quite distinct, with various tribal groups living there.

Now, when thinking about pets, in many parts of India, dogs are commonly kept as pets. But maybe in Assam, there's a different trend. I remember that in some regions, especially those with tribal populations, people might have different preferences for pets. For example, some tribes might keep animals that are more useful for their lifestyle, like cattle or goats, but those are more for farming or livelihood rather than family pets.

Wait, but the question specifies a family pet, which is more of a companion animal. So maybe dogs are still the answer. However, I should check if there's a specific animal that's more popular there. Another thought: Assam has a lot of rivers and water bodies. Do people there keep aquatic pets? Or maybe cats? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a local breed of dog that's popular there. For instance, some regions have specific dog breeds that are favored. But I don't recall a specific breed unique to Assam. Another angle: looking at cultural festivals or traditions. Do they have any festivals that involve animals? Maybe not directly related to pets.

I should also consider that in rural areas, pets might be more utilitarian. For example, cows are sacred in many parts of India, but they are not typically family pets. Goats or sheep might be kept, but again, for farming. In urban areas of Assam, maybe dogs are more common as pets. But is there a specific animal that's more popular than others?

Wait, I think I've heard that in some parts of Northeast India, people keep parrots or birds as pets. But I'm not certain if that's the case in Assam specifically. Alternatively, maybe cats are becoming more popular, as they are in many urban areas across India.

But without specific data, it's hard to be sure. However, based on general knowledge, dogs are the most common pets in India, including Assam. Unless there's a cultural or regional preference I'm not aware of. Since I don't have specific information pointing to another animal being more popular in Assam, I'll go with dogs as the answer. But I should make sure there isn",1,,
Gu-ch-08,What is the most popular sports among children in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular sports among children in Assam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. It's a state in northeastern India, known for its cultural diversity and various traditional games. 

First, I should consider common sports that are popular in India in general. Cricket is a huge sport there, but I'm not sure if it's the most popular among children specifically in Assam. Then there's football (soccer), which is popular in many parts of India, especially in states like West Bengal and Kerala. Maybe Assam has a similar trend?

Also, Assam has a rich tradition of indigenous sports. For example, I remember something about a game called ""Khel"" or ""Bou"" which might be traditional. But I'm not certain. There's also ""Mangalaguri"" which is a traditional sport, but I'm not sure how popular it is among children now.

Another angle: school sports. In many schools, games like cricket, football, volleyball, and kho-kho are commonly played. Maybe these are the ones that are most popular. However, the question is about Assam specifically. Are there any sports that are more regionally popular there?

I should check if there are any notable sports events or teams from Assam. For instance, Assam has produced some footballers, which might indicate that football is popular. Also, considering the geographical aspect, maybe games that can be played in open fields are more common, like football or kabaddi.

But I need to be careful not to assume. If there's no specific data, maybe the answer is a combination of traditional and modern sports. However, the question asks for the most popular, so likely one primary sport. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a single most popular sport, but the user wants a list. However, the example given in the JSON format shows a list with one item. So perhaps the answer is football, given its popularity in the region and among children. Or maybe cricket. But I need to verify.

Wait, some sources indicate that football is quite popular in Assam, with the state having a strong football culture. For example, the Assam Rifles football team and the presence of football academies. Also, the state has produced notable footballers. So maybe football is the most popular sport among children there.

But I should also consider if other sports like cricket are more prevalent. However, given the infrastructure and media coverage",1,,
New-as-20,What is the most popular indoor sport in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Assam is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its tea plantations, biodiversity, and rich cultural heritage. Now, when it comes to sports, I know that in India, cricket is extremely popular nationwide. But the question is about an indoor sport specifically in Assam.

Wait, indoor sports can include things like table tennis, badminton, carrom, chess, or even sports like billiards. But I need to check if there's a particular sport that's more popular in Assam compared to others. However, I don't recall any specific indoor sport that's uniquely popular in Assam. Maybe I should think about the infrastructure or cultural aspects. For example, in some regions, certain games are more common due to local traditions or availability of facilities.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me. If I consider that Assam is known for traditional sports like boat racing (like Bihu), but those are outdoor. However, the question specifies indoor. Another angle: maybe the most popular indoor sport in Assam is similar to other parts of India, like table tennis or badminton. But I'm not sure if there's any data or surveys indicating that. Alternatively, could it be carrom? Carrom is a traditional indoor game in India, but again, is it more popular in Assam than elsewhere?

Wait, I should check if there's any notable presence of a particular indoor sport in Assam. For example, maybe Assam has a strong presence in a particular sport. However, without specific information, it's hard to say. But since the question asks for the most popular, and considering that cricket is the most popular sport in India overall, but it's played outdoors. So the indoor equivalent might be something else. However, maybe the answer is table tennis or badminton. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is chess. But again, not sure. Wait, maybe the answer is carrom. But I need to be careful here. Since the user is asking for the most popular, and if there's no specific data, maybe the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized indoor sport that's more popular in Assam than others. However, the question expects an answer, so I need to make an educated guess based on general knowledge.

Given that, I think the most probable answer is that the",1,,

New-in-01,Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Assam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in东北印度, known for its tea plantations. Wait, but the question is about coffee shops. Maybe there's a mix-up here? Or perhaps there are coffee shops in Assam despite the tea focus.

First, I should check if there are any well-known coffee chains in Assam. Starbucks, Café Coffee Day, or local brands? I know that in many parts of India, Café Coffee Day is pretty common, but I'm not sure about Assam specifically. Also, there might be local coffee shops that are more popular than national chains.

Wait, maybe the user is conflating tea and coffee? Assam is famous for tea, like Assam tea. But the question is about coffee shops. Maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific well-known coffee shop brand in Assam, but rather local cafes or maybe a particular chain that's more prevalent there. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the most popular is a local brand rather than an international one.

I should also consider if there are any recent trends. Maybe a local chain has gained popularity. But without specific data, it's hard to say. However, since the user is asking for the most popular, and given that Assam's main beverage is tea, maybe the coffee shop scene isn't as developed. But that doesn't mean there aren't popular spots.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no single most popular brand, but if I have to choose, perhaps a local one. However, I'm not sure. Maybe I should check if there's any information on this. But since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I think in India, Café Coffee Day is more widespread, but in Assam, maybe it's different. Alternatively, there might be a brand like The Coffee Bean or others. But I'm not certain. 

Wait, maybe the answer is that there isn't a dominant coffee shop brand in Assam, but the question requires an answer. In that case, perhaps the best approach is to state that there isn't a single most popular brand, but if forced to choose, maybe a local one. However, without specific data, this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the popularity is split between local cafes and national chains like Café Coffee Day. But the question asks for",1,,

New-en-47,What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Assam. First, I need to recall what Assam is known for. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its tea plantations, biodiversity, and tropical climate.

So, back gardens in Assam... Well, given the climate, maybe they have plants that thrive in warm, humid conditions. Tea plants come to mind because Assam is famous for its tea. But wait, tea plantations are usually large-scale agricultural areas, not individual back gardens. However, maybe some households might have small tea plants in their gardens?

Also, Assam has a lot of flora. There are various types of trees and plants native to the region. Maybe fruit trees like mango or jackfruit? Or maybe medicinal plants? Also, since the climate is tropical, there might be flowering plants or ornamental trees.

Another thought: in many Indian homes, especially in rural areas, people grow vegetables or herbs in their backyards. So maybe vegetables like spinach, eggplant, or herbs like mint. But the question specifies ""typically"" found, so what's common?

Wait, but the user is asking specifically about back gardens. In Assam, due to the high rainfall and humidity, there might be more greenery. Also, maybe bamboo? Since bamboo is common in the region. Or maybe fish ponds? Some people might have small ponds for fish farming in their backyards.

But I need to be careful. Are these things actually common in residential back gardens? Tea plants might not be typical for individual homes because they require specific conditions and are usually grown commercially. However, maybe some people have small tea bushes. Alternatively, maybe they have other plants like betel leaves (paan) or areca nut trees, which are common in some parts of northeast India.

Also, considering the cultural aspect, maybe religious or decorative plants. For example, tulsi (holy basil) is commonly grown in Indian homes for religious purposes. That might be present in back gardens as well.

Putting it all together, the most likely answer would be tea plants, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe it's more about fruit trees or medicinal plants. Wait, I should check if there's a common element. Since Assam's economy is heavily based on tea, perhaps even in residential areas, people might have some tea plants. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in many parts of India, backyards have",1,,

Ji-ko-25,What are the family-related holidays in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about family-related holidays in Assam. Let me think. First, I need to recall the major festivals in Assam that are celebrated by families.

Bihu comes to mind immediately. There are different types of Bihu—Rongali, Bhogali, and Kati. Rongali Bihu is the most prominent, celebrated in April, marking the Assamese New Year. It's a time for family gatherings, traditional dances, and feasts. So that's definitely a family holiday.

Then there's Durga Puja, which is a major Hindu festival. Even though it's more widespread across India, in Assam, it's celebrated with great enthusiasm. Families come together for prayers, rituals, and community events. So that should be included.

Another one is Diwali, the festival of lights. It's a national holiday and widely observed in Assam. Families light lamps, exchange gifts, and have feasts. Definitely a family-related holiday.

Holi is also celebrated in Assam, though maybe not as intensely as in other parts of India. Still, it's a family festival with color-throwing and feasting.

Christmas is another one, especially in areas with a Christian population. Families gather for church services, meals, and celebrations.

Wait, are there any other regional festivals specific to Assam that are family-oriented? Maybe the Magh Bihu, which is also known as Bhogali Bihu. It's celebrated in January, after the harvest season. Families prepare special dishes like 'pitha' and 'dal', and there's a lot of community feasting. That's definitely family-related.

What about the Assamese New Year, which is Rongali Bihu? I already mentioned that. Also, maybe the Bihu dance festivals where families participate together. But the main holidays would be the ones recognized as public holidays.

Let me check if there are any other significant ones. The Hornbill Festival is more of a tribal festival in Nagaland, not Assam. So probably not. Then there's the Bihu festival, Durga Puja, Diwali, Holi, Christmas, and Magh Bihu. Are there any others?

I think that's a comprehensive list. I should make sure these are all family-related and observed in Assam. Let me confirm each one:

- Rongali Bihu: Yes, family gatherings, traditional activities.
- Durga Puja: Celebrated with family rituals.",1,,

Ta-pe-29,Which professional sport is the highest paying in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which professional sport is the highest paying in Assam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India. I know that cricket is a popular sport there, like in many other parts of India. But are there other sports that might be more prominent or better paid?

First, I should consider the major professional sports in India. Cricket is definitely the most popular and well-funded. But maybe in Assam, there are specific sports that have more opportunities or higher earnings. For example, I know that Assam has a strong presence in sports like badminton, football, and maybe even weightlifting. However, are these professional sports with high pay?

I should think about professional leagues. In India, the Indian Premier League (IPL) is a top-tier cricket league, but it's not specific to Assam. However, Assam might have local leagues or teams that participate in larger tournaments. Are there other sports with professional leagues in Assam? I'm not sure. Maybe football, like the I-League, but again, not sure if Assam has teams that are particularly high-paying.

Another angle: which sports have athletes from Assam who are well-known and earn a lot? For example, maybe cricketers from Assam who play in the Indian team or in the IPL. If there are prominent cricketers from Assam, that might indicate that cricket is the highest paying. Alternatively, maybe sports like boxing or wrestling have successful athletes from Assam who earn a lot.

Wait, I remember that Assam has produced some notable athletes in different sports. For instance, there's the case of Shiva Keshavan, an Indian luger, but he's from Tamil Nadu, I think. Maybe not Assam. Let me check my memory. Oh, there's also the case of Dhanraj Pillay, but he's from Rajasthan. Maybe in Assam, the focus is more on cricket. 

Also, considering the infrastructure and media coverage. Cricket has a lot of media attention, which might lead to higher sponsorship deals and salaries. Even if Assam doesn't have a lot of professional leagues, individual athletes might still earn more from cricket. 

But I'm not certain. Maybe the answer is cricket, but I need to be sure. Are there any other sports in Assam that are more lucrative? For example, if there's a strong presence in professional football or something else. However, I don",1,,

Ji-ko-40,What do high school students typically do during break time in schools in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about what high school students in Assam do during break time. First, I need to consider the cultural and geographical context of Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its diverse culture, including Assamese traditions, festivals, and maybe even some local customs that might influence school activities.

High school break times are usually short, maybe 15-30 minutes, so activities would be quick. Common activities across India might include chatting with friends, eating snacks, playing games. But in Assam, there might be specific local elements. For example, maybe they play traditional games like Khokho or Kabbadi, which are popular in many parts of India. Also, considering the climate, if it's hot, they might seek shade or have some outdoor activities. 

Another angle: Assam has a strong tradition of music and dance. Maybe students engage in cultural activities during breaks, like singing folk songs or dancing. Also, since Assam is known for its tea plantations, perhaps some students might have tea breaks, but that might be more for teachers. However, maybe they have local snacks like pitha or other traditional Assamese foods during breaks.

Additionally, considering the school environment, students might gather in groups, study in small clusters, or engage in group discussions. There could be a mix of academic and social activities. Also, since Assam has a lot of greenery, maybe they spend time outdoors, playing games or just relaxing in the open spaces.

I should also think about any regional festivals or events that might influence break activities. If a festival is approaching, students might prepare or discuss it during breaks. However, since the question is about typical break time, not during festivals, maybe that's less relevant.

Another point: the language. Assamese is the primary language, so students might communicate in Assamese during breaks, but that's more about language than activity. 

Potential answer list: Chatting with friends, playing outdoor games (like Khokho, Kabbadi, football), eating traditional snacks, studying in groups, listening to music, engaging in cultural activities like singing folk songs, using mobile phones, resting in shaded areas, etc.

I need to ensure that the answer is specific to Assam. So including traditional games and local snacks would make it more accurate. Also, considering the climate, maybe resting or seeking shade is a common activity. However, the exact activities might not be drastically different from other parts",1,,
Th-en-15,What is the most popular winter sport in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular winter sport in Assam is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeast India, known for its tea plantations, biodiversity, and the Brahmaputra River. The climate there is typically tropical, with hot and humid summers, and a monsoon season. Winters in Assam are relatively mild compared to other parts of India, but they do get cooler.

Now, thinking about winter sports. Most winter sports like skiing, ice hockey, or snowboarding require snow, which Assam probably doesn't have. The winters there aren't cold enough for snow. So maybe the question is a bit tricky. But maybe there's a local sport that's popular during winter. Let me think.

In India, common sports vary by region. For example, cricket is popular nationwide, but maybe in Assam, there's something else. Wait, Assam has a lot of rivers and water bodies. Maybe boating or rowing? But is that considered a winter sport? Or maybe something like polo? I know that polo is played in some parts of India, but I'm not sure about Assam specifically.

Alternatively, maybe it's a traditional sport. For example, in some regions, people play games like kabaddi or kho-kho, but those are more common in other parts. Wait, but those are usually played year-round. Maybe winter festivals have specific activities. Assam has festivals like Bihu, which are cultural events, but not sports.

Another angle: maybe the question is a bit of a trick, since Assam doesn't have snow, so there's no traditional winter sport like skiing. However, maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific winter sport, but the most popular sport in general. But the question specifically asks for a winter sport.

Wait, maybe the answer is that there's no popular winter sport in Assam because of the climate. But the user is expecting an answer. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is something like ""There is no popular winter sport in Assam due to the lack of snow and cold weather."" But the user wants a single answer in a list. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a local sport that's played during winter. For example, in some regions, people play games on frozen lakes, but again, Assam's winters might not be cold enough for that. Maybe something like field hockey? But that's played in other seasons too.

Jo-sp-13,What is the most popular water sport in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular water sport in Assam is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its rivers, tea plantations, and biodiversity. It has several rivers like the Brahmaputra, which is a major river there.

Water sports typically include activities like swimming, boating, kayaking, rafting, fishing, etc. But which of these is most popular in Assam? I know that river rafting is a common activity in some parts of India, like in Rishikesh, but does that happen in Assam too? The Brahmaputra River is quite large and might be suitable for rafting. However, I'm not sure if it's the most popular.

Another possibility is fishing. Assam has a lot of rivers and wetlands, so fishing could be a popular activity. But is it considered a sport there? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Then there's boating. Maybe sightseeing cruises on the Brahmaputra? Or maybe something like kayaking?

Wait, I should check if there's any specific water sport that's well-known in Assam. I remember that Assam has some adventure tourism spots. For example, the Kaziranga National Park is nearby, but that's more about wildlife. However, there might be water-based activities in the river systems.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a traditional sport but something like boat racing. Do they have boat races in Assam? I'm not sure. Another angle: looking at the local culture. Do they have any traditional water sports? Maybe not. So perhaps the most popular is river rafting on the Brahmaputra, given the river's size and the potential for adventure tourism.

But I need to confirm if rafting is actually popular there. Maybe I should think about other sources. If I can't find specific information, maybe the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized single most popular water sport, but given the options, rafting or fishing might be the closest. However, since the question asks for the most popular, and considering that Assam's rivers are a major attraction, river rafting might be the answer. Alternatively, maybe it's not a sport but a common activity. Wait, but the question specifies ""water sport,"" so it's an activity that's considered a sport.

Na-ko-29,Who is the most famous swimmer in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most famous swimmer from Assam is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its tea plantations, rivers like the Brahmaputra, and rich cultural heritage. But when it comes to sports, especially swimming, I'm not too familiar with specific athletes from there.

First, I should check if there are any notable swimmers from Assam. Maybe there's someone who has won national or international competitions. I know that India has produced some good swimmers like Virat Kohli, but wait, no, he's a cricketer. Oh right, the swimmers are people like Rani Rampal, but she's from Haryana, I think. Maybe I'm mixing up states.

Let me think. There's a swimmer named Sajan Prakash, but I believe he's from Kerala. Another name that comes to mind is Dutee Chand, but she's from Odisha. Maybe I should check if there are any athletes from Assam in the swimming category. 

Wait, perhaps there are not many famous swimmers from Assam. Maybe the state isn't known for producing swimmers, unlike other states that have strong athletic traditions. If that's the case, the answer might be that there isn't a widely recognized swimmer from Assam, or maybe someone local who's famous regionally but not nationally.

Alternatively, maybe there's a swimmer from Assam who has gained recognition in recent years. I should verify if there's any recent news about Assam swimmers. Let me think. I don't recall any prominent names from Assam in swimming. It's possible that the answer is that there isn't a well-known swimmer from Assam, but the question asks for the most famous, so maybe the answer is that there isn't one, or perhaps a local athlete.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects a name even if it's not internationally famous. Maybe someone like Manoj Kumar, but I'm not sure. I need to be careful here. If I can't find a specific name, the answer might be that there's no notable swimmer from Assam. But I need to make sure I'm not missing someone.

Another approach: check if any Assamese swimmers have participated in national championships or the Olympics. If not, then the answer would be that there isn't a famous swimmer from Assam. But I need to",1,,
New-su-57,What is the most common livestock raised in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most common livestock raised in Assam is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam. Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its tea plantations and diverse culture. But what about livestock?

I remember that in many parts of India, cattle like cows and buffaloes are commonly raised. But Assam might have its own specifics. Maybe because of the climate and agricultural practices there. Also, there are various tribes and communities in Assam, and their traditional practices might influence the types of livestock they keep.

Wait, I think Assam has a significant population of cattle. But I'm not sure if it's the most common. There's also poultry, like chickens, which are raised in many places. However, considering the rural economy and agricultural needs, cattle might be more prevalent. Buffaloes are often used for plowing fields and milk production. But maybe goats or sheep are also common?

Alternatively, I've heard that in some regions, pigs are raised more. But I'm not certain about Assam specifically. Let me think about the main agricultural activities. Assam has a lot of rice cultivation, which might require water buffaloes for plowing. Also, dairy farming could be significant, so cows and buffaloes for milk. However, the question is about the ""most common"" livestock. 

Another angle: government reports or agricultural statistics. If I can't access that, I have to rely on general knowledge. In India, cattle (including cows and buffaloes) are widely kept, but maybe in Assam, the prevalence of certain breeds is higher. For example, the Assamese cattle breed is native to the region. However, I'm not sure if that's the most common.

Wait, maybe the answer is cattle. But I should check if there's a more specific answer. Alternatively, could it be poultry? But I think in most rural areas, large livestock like cattle are more common than poultry. Also, the state's economy relies on agriculture, and livestock plays a role in that.

Another thought: in some parts of India, goats are more common because they require less space and feed. But again, Assam's geography might favor cattle. I think I need to settle on cattle as the most common, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is buffalo. 

Wait, I found in some sources that Assam has a significant number of cattle, including cows and buff",1,,

New-ch-38,Which cities or regions are known for their import and export activities in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which cities or regions in Assam are known for their import and export activities. Let me start by recalling what I know about Assam's economy.

Assam is a state in northeastern India. It's known for its agricultural products, especially tea. The Brahmaputra River is a major geographical feature there. Now, import and export activities usually happen in places with good connectivity, ports, or trade routes.

Guwahati comes to mind first. It's the largest city in Assam and a major commercial hub. There's an airport there, and it's connected by roads and rivers. Maybe Guwahati is a key city for trade.

Then there's Dibrugarh. I remember that there's an oil refinery there, maybe related to petroleum products. Also, Dibrugarh is near the border with Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, which might make it a point for cross-border trade.

Silchar is another city in Assam, located near the border with Bangladesh. There's the Silchar Airport and the Barak River, which might be important for trade with neighboring countries. Also, the India-Bangladesh border here could facilitate exports and imports.

Tezpur is in the Sonitpur district. I think it's a historical trade center and has a river port on the Brahmaputra. That might be significant for riverine trade.

Jorhat is known for its tea industry. Since tea is a major export from Assam, Jorhat might be involved in exporting tea products. But I'm not sure if it's a major hub for import/export activities beyond that.

Maybe the regions along the Brahmaputra River are important because of the river transport. Places like Nagaon or Goalpara might be involved in trade through the river. However, I'm not certain about their prominence in import/export specifically.

I should also consider the ports. Assam doesn't have a seaport, but the river ports might be important. Guwahati has a river port, which could be a key point for exporting goods via the Brahmaputra to other parts of India or neighboring countries.

Dhubri is another city near the border with Bangladesh. There's a railway line there, and it's a major trading point with Bangladesh. So Dhubri might be significant for cross-border trade.

Putting this together, the main cities would be Guwahati, Dibrugarh, Silchar, Tezpur, and Dhub",1,,
New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Assam? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Assam. Let me start by recalling what middle school typically covers. In India, middle school usually refers to classes 6 to 8. Now, the curriculum in Assam might follow the state's educational guidelines, which could be part of the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) framework but might have some regional variations.

First, I should consider the standard subjects taught in Indian middle schools. Typically, they include subjects like English, Hindi, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, and maybe a regional language like Assamese. Additionally, there might be subjects like Environmental Studies (EVS) in lower classes, but by middle school, that might be split into Science and Social Science. Also, subjects like Physical Education, Art, Music, and Computer Science are often part of the curriculum.

Wait, but the question is about Assam specifically. I need to check if there are any unique subjects or if the structure is the same as other states. However, I don't have specific information about Assam's curriculum. The NCERT syllabus for classes 6-8 includes subjects like:

1. English
2. Hindi
3. Mathematics
4. Science
5. Social Science
6. Regional Language (Assamese in this case)
7. Computer Studies
8. Art and Craft
9. Physical Education
10. Work Experience (sometimes)

But some of these might be optional or vary by school. If we count the core subjects, it might be around 6-7, but including optional ones, it could be more. However, the exact number might depend on the specific school and whether they follow the state curriculum or not. Without specific data, it's hard to give an exact number. But since the user is asking for a specific number, maybe the standard answer expected is 6 or 7. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 8, considering the core subjects plus regional language and others. But I need to be careful here. Maybe checking the Assam government's education department website would help, but since I can't access that, I have to rely on general knowledge. In many Indian states, middle schools have 6-7 main subjects, including regional language, English, Hindi, Math, Science, and Social Science. Adding Computer and Physical Education might bring it to 8. However, some sources might list it as 6 core subjects",1,,
Th-en-03,What is the most popular professional sports league in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular professional sports league is in Assam. First, I should recall where Assam is. Assam is a state in northeastern India. Now, thinking about sports leagues there.

I know that in India, cricket is the most popular sport overall. But the question is about a professional sports league specifically in Assam. Are there any professional leagues based in Assam? I'm not sure. Maybe there's a state-level league for cricket or football (soccer)?

Wait, the Indian Super League (ISL) is for football, but that's a national league, not specific to Assam. Similarly, the Indian Premier League (IPL) is cricket, but again, that's national. Maybe Assam has its own regional leagues?

I remember that in some states, there are state cricket associations. For example, the Assam Cricket Association might organize tournaments. But are those considered professional leagues? Maybe not at the highest level. 

Another angle: Assam has a strong tradition in sports like football, badminton, and athletics. But do they have a professional league? I'm not certain. Maybe the Assam Football League? Or perhaps there's a professional league that's not as well-known nationally.

Wait, but the question is about the most popular one. If there isn't a prominent professional league, maybe the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized professional sports league in Assam, and the popularity is more in local or amateur levels. However, the user might be expecting a specific answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Indian Super League if it's the most popular in the region, but that's not Assam-specific.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there is no professional sports league in Assam, and the most popular sports are played in local tournaments. But I need to check if there's any official league. 

After some thinking, I think the answer might be that there isn't a prominent professional sports league in Assam, but if I have to provide an answer, maybe the Assam Cricket Association's tournaments or local leagues. However, since the question specifies ""professional,"" which might require a structured league with professional teams. If no such league exists, the answer could be that there isn't a widely recognized professional sports league in Assam. But I need to confirm.

Wait, I recall that the Assam Football League exists, but I'm not sure if it's professional. Alternatively, the Northeastern states have some",1,,

Ji-ko-33,Where do high school students in Assam usually go after dinner?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking where high school students in Assam usually go after dinner. First, I need to think about Assam's culture and the typical daily routines of students there.

Assam is a state in northeastern India, known for its diverse cultures and traditions. High school students there might have different habits compared to other regions. After dinner, common activities could include studying, hanging out with friends, or engaging in leisure activities.

I should consider the local context. In many parts of India, after dinner, students might study for exams, especially if they have upcoming tests. Alternatively, they might go to local hangouts like tea shops, which are common in Assam. There's also the possibility of religious or cultural activities, but that might be more specific to certain communities.

Another angle is the time of year. If it's exam season, studying would be more prevalent. But the question is general, so I need a common answer. Also, considering urban vs. rural areas, but since the question doesn't specify, I should stick to a general answer.

I recall that in many Indian states, after dinner, students might gather in groups, maybe at a park or a local café. However, in Assam, the tea culture is significant, so maybe tea shops or stalls are common places. Alternatively, they might go home and study, or meet friends at a nearby place.

I should also think about possible leisure activities. Maybe watching TV, playing games, or using mobile phones. But the question is about physical places they go to. So, places like parks, community centers, or local eateries.

Wait, but the answer needs to be concise. The user wants one single answer in a list. So, the most probable answer is that they might go to study, or maybe to local hangouts. However, in many cases, after dinner, students might study for exams, especially in high school. So, the answer could be ""home to study"" or ""local tea shops or parks.""

But I need to verify. Are there specific places in Assam that are common for students post-dinner? Maybe the local community centers or study groups. Alternatively, considering that Assam has a strong tradition of education, students might focus on studying. However, in some cases, they might also go out with friends.

I think the safest answer, considering the general trend, is that high school students in Assam usually go home to study after dinner. However, if there's a",1,,
Ni-en-31,What do people in Assam traditionally eat on Christmas Day?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about traditional Christmas foods in Assam. I need to figure out what people there typically eat on that day.

First, I know that Assam is a state in India, and it's known for its tea plantations and diverse cultures. But Christmas is a Christian holiday, so maybe the food is influenced by both local Assamese cuisine and Western traditions.

Traditional Assamese food includes things like fish, rice, and various curries. For example, ""khichu"" (a rice and lentil dish) is common. But on Christmas, there might be a mix of local and Western dishes. However, since the question is about traditional Assamese Christmas food, I should focus on what's specific to the region during that time.

Wait, I'm not sure if there are specific dishes unique to Assam for Christmas. Maybe they have a version of Christmas cake or other baked goods, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, they might prepare a special meal with local ingredients. Maybe ""pitha"" (a type of sweet rice cake) or ""luchi"" (deep-fried bread) could be part of the celebration. But I need to verify if these are actually traditional for Christmas in Assam.

Alternatively, since many Assamese people are Christians, especially in regions like Goalpara, they might have a mix of both local and Western dishes. However, the question is about traditional Assamese food, so perhaps it's more about the local dishes they prepare specifically on Christmas. Maybe they have a special fish curry or a festive rice dish.

I think I should check if there's any specific dish that's commonly associated with Christmas in Assam. If not, then perhaps the answer is that they eat similar to other Indian regions, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe they have a unique dish like ""Assam Christmas cake"" or something else. But I'm not finding specific information on that. 

Wait, maybe the answer is that they eat traditional Assamese dishes like ""bhapa dokhi"" (a fermented fish dish) or ""masor tenga"" (a tomato and fish curry), but I'm not sure if these are specifically for Christmas. Alternatively, during festivals, they might prepare ""pitha"" and ""luchi"" as part of the celebration. However, I'm not certain if this is exclusive to Christmas or other festivals.

Since I can't find a definitive answer, perhaps the safest bet is to mention",1,,
Al-en-36,What food is associated with Halloween in Assam?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the food associated with Halloween in Assam. First, I need to recall if Assam, which is a state in India, has any specific traditional foods linked to Halloween. Wait, Halloween is more of a Western holiday, celebrated on October 31st. But in India, including Assam, people might not traditionally celebrate Halloween in the same way as in the West.

So, maybe there's a mix of local traditions and maybe some adaptation of Halloween themes. However, I need to check if there's a specific food item that's connected. Alternatively, perhaps the user is confused because Assam has its own festivals around that time, like Bihu, but Bihu is usually in April, so maybe not overlapping with Halloween.

Alternatively, could there be a local dish that's made around that time or used in any celebrations? I'm not sure. Maybe the user is thinking of a specific dish that's used in any Halloween-themed events in Assam, but I don't recall any specific ones. Perhaps the answer is that there isn't a traditional food associated with Halloween in Assam, as Halloween isn't widely celebrated there. However, the question seems to imply that there is one. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Assam has some sweet or dish that's commonly made during festivals, and people might use it for Halloween events. For example, traditional Assamese sweets like pitha or laru. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe there's a modern trend of using jack-o'-lanterns with local produce, but that's not a food. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there is no specific food associated, but the user wants a list. However, the user's instruction says to provide one answer as a list. Maybe the answer is that there isn't a traditional food, but since the user is expecting an answer, perhaps there's a local dish that's sometimes associated. Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question where the answer is that Halloween isn't celebrated in Assam, so no specific food. But I need to be careful here.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific event or a local custom. However, I can't find any references to Halloween-specific foods in Assam. So the safest answer might be that there is no traditional food associated with Halloween in Assam, but since the user wants a list, perhaps the answer is an empty list or a non-existent item. However, the",1,,
