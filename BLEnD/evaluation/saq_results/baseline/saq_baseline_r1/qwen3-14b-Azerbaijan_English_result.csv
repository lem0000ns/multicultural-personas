Ji-ko-29,Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Azerbaijan's society?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Azerbaijan's society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and traditions.

First, I remember that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some countries, turning 18 is a big deal because it marks adulthood. In others, like in some Middle Eastern cultures, the 13th birthday might be important because of religious or traditional reasons. But I'm not sure about Azerbaijan specifically.

Wait, I think in Azerbaijan, there's a tradition called ""Nowruz,"" which is a Persian New Year celebration, but that's more about the spring equinox and not specifically a birthday. However, maybe there's another tradition related to birthdays. 

Another angle: sometimes the 50th birthday is considered a milestone in many cultures, like a ""golden"" anniversary. But I'm not certain if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe the 60th or 70th birthday is significant. 

Wait, I recall that in some Turkic cultures, the 50th birthday is a major event. For example, in Turkey, the 50th birthday is called ""Ellinci"" and is celebrated with a big party. Since Azerbaijan is a Turkic country, perhaps they share similar traditions. 

But I need to verify if this applies to Azerbaijan specifically. Let me think if there are any other clues. Maybe looking at common practices. In some places, the 18th birthday is a big deal for coming of age, but in Azerbaijan, maybe the 21st or another age. However, I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with a different country. Wait, I think I've heard that in Azerbaijan, the 50th birthday is considered the most significant. Maybe because it's a major life milestone, similar to other cultures. But I need to be careful here. 

Alternatively, could it be the 60th? In some East Asian cultures, 60 is a significant age because it's a cycle in the Chinese zodiac. But Azerbaijan is not East Asian. 

Wait, I should check if there's a specific term or tradition in Azerbaijani for a certain age. Maybe the ""Yuz yas"" (100 years) but that's for a centenary, which is rare. 

Alternatively, maybe the 18th birthday is when someone gets",1,,

New-pe-06,What is the most popular stew in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular stew in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that stews are a big part of their food culture, especially with lamb or other meats. There's a dish called ""pilaf,"" but that's more like a rice dish. Then there's ""dolma,"" which are stuffed vegetables, but that's not a stew.

Wait, maybe ""kufte"" is a possibility, but that's more like meatballs. Let me think. Oh, there's a stew called ""khash."" I think that's a traditional soup made from cow's feet or bones, often eaten in the winter. But is that considered a stew? It's more of a soup, but maybe in some contexts, it's referred to as a stew. Alternatively, there's ""tovuq pilaf,"" which is chicken pilaf, but again, not a stew.

Another possibility is ""shish kebab,"" but that's grilled meat. Maybe ""dolma"" is sometimes cooked in a stew-like broth? No, I think dolma is more like stuffed grape leaves. What about ""ghormeh sabzi""? Wait, that's an Iranian dish, maybe similar to Azerbaijani cuisine, but I'm not sure if it's the most popular there.

Wait, I should verify. Khash is definitely a traditional dish in Azerbaijan, especially during cold months. It's made with boiled cow's feet, bones, and other parts, simmered for a long time, and served with onions, garlic, and sometimes wine. It's quite popular, even though it's more of a soup. However, maybe there's another stew that's more commonly referred to as a stew. Alternatively, ""plov"" is a rice dish, but again, not a stew.

Alternatively, ""shirin plov"" is a sweet rice dish, but not a stew. Maybe ""qutab"" or ""laghman,"" but those are more like flatbreads or noodles. I think I need to confirm if khash is considered the most popular stew. Alternatively, there's ""mujadara,"" which is a lentil and rice dish, but that's more common in Levantine cuisine.

Wait, maybe ""dolma"" is sometimes made with a stew-like sauce. No, I think the answer is khash. It's a traditional and popular dish in Azerbaijan, even",1,,

Th-en-53,What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular extracurricular social event is at schools in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of cultures, and they have a strong emphasis on education. Now, extracurricular activities can vary widely, but I should think about common events in schools there.

First, I know that cultural events are significant in many countries, especially those with rich traditions. Azerbaijan has a vibrant culture with music, dance, and festivals. So maybe something like a cultural festival or a music and dance event? I've heard about events like ""Novruz,"" which is a traditional New Year celebration in Azerbaijan, but I'm not sure if that's an extracurricular school event or a public holiday.

Another possibility is sports events. Many schools have sports days, competitions, or tournaments. But the question specifies a social event, which might lean more towards cultural or community aspects rather than purely athletic. However, sports days can be social too.

Then there's the possibility of academic competitions or debates, but those might be more academic than social. The question is about social events, so perhaps something that brings students together in a more informal or celebratory way.

I should also consider if there are any unique events specific to Azerbaijani schools. Maybe something like a school festival, talent show, or a traditional dance performance. Alternatively, charity events or community service projects, but again, the popularity might vary.

Wait, I remember reading that in some countries, school balls or prom-like events are popular, but I'm not sure about Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe there are events related to national holidays or historical events, which might be more common in schools there.

Another angle: looking at the structure of schools in Azerbaijan. They might have a lot of emphasis on music and arts. Maybe music festivals or competitions. Or perhaps poetry recitation events, given the literary traditions in the region.

But I need to confirm which one is the most popular. If I can't find specific data, I might have to go with the most common answer based on cultural significance. Since Novruz is a major holiday, but I'm not sure if it's an extracurricular event. Alternatively, school cultural festivals where students showcase traditional music, dance, and arts might be the most popular social events.

Alternatively, maybe ""school days"" or ""cultural days"" where students participate in various activities. Another possibility is the """,1,,

Jod-ch-01,What eating utensils do people commonly used in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what eating utensils are commonly used in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and dining habits.

First, I know that in many countries in the Caucasus region, including Azerbaijan, people often use a combination of utensils. I remember that the traditional meal in Azerbaijan, called ""pilaf"" or ""plov,"" is usually eaten with hands, but that might be more for certain dishes. However, for other meals, they might use utensils.

Wait, there's a specific set of utensils used in some parts of the Caucasus. I think they might use a knife, fork, and spoon. But maybe there's something more traditional. Oh, right! I've heard about the ""dolma"" and ""khash"" dishes, but I'm not sure about the utensils. 

Also, considering that Azerbaijan is a Muslim country, the use of hands might be common for certain foods, but for others, they might use utensils. However, I need to be precise. Let me think about the typical dining setup. In restaurants and formal settings, people probably use a knife, fork, and spoon. But maybe there's a specific order or type. 

Wait, I should check if there's a traditional set. In some cultures, like in parts of the Middle East, people might use a fork and knife, but not a spoon. However, Azerbaijan is part of the Caucasus, which is a mix of cultures. Maybe they use a spoon more often. 

Wait, in many Central Asian countries, the spoon is commonly used. For example, in Uzbekistan, they use a spoon and knife. So maybe in Azerbaijan, the common utensils are a spoon, knife, and fork. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they use a knife and fork, similar to Western countries. 

Another angle: looking at the structure of a typical meal. If they eat rice dishes, which are common, they might use a spoon. For meats, a knife. And a fork for other items. But I'm not sure if the fork is commonly used. Some sources say that in Azerbaijan, people often use a knife and spoon, while the fork is less common. 

Wait, I think I need to confirm. Let me think about the traditional ""sumakh"" or ""shashlik"" (kebabs). Those might be eaten with a knife and fork. But maybe the spoon is used for sou",1,,

New-gr-15,What is the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that Azerbaijani food is influenced by both Persian and Turkish cuisines, and they have a variety of dishes, including lots of meat and rice, but I'm more interested in desserts here.

I think they have a dessert called ""pilav,"" but wait, pilav is more of a rice dish, maybe not a dessert. Then there's ""baklava,"" which is a common dessert in many Middle Eastern and Balkan countries. But I'm not sure if that's specific to Azerbaijan or just common there too. Another possibility is ""shekerbura,"" which I think is a type of sweet roll or something similar to a brioche. I've heard that term before in the context of Azerbaijani desserts. 

Wait, I should verify. Maybe ""gogal"" is another one, but I think that's more of a savory dish. Let me think again. There's also ""muhallabiya,"" which is a type of milk pudding, popular in the Middle East. But is that considered traditional in Azerbaijan? 

Alternatively, ""shirin pilav"" is a sweet rice pudding, but I'm not sure if it's the most popular. Another thought: ""sahlab"" is a dessert made from orchid roots, but that might be more associated with Turkey. 

I think the most commonly mentioned dessert from Azerbaijan is ""shekerbura."" It's a sweet, syrupy pastry that's similar to a brioche or a type of roll. I've seen it in some recipes and cultural references. However, I should check if there's another dessert that's more traditional or more popular. 

Wait, another possibility is ""baklava,"" but since it's common in many countries, maybe it's not the most specific to Azerbaijan. However, in some regions of Azerbaijan, they might have their own version. But I think ""shekerbura"" is more unique to the region. 

Alternatively, maybe ""milk pudding"" or ""shirin pilav"" is more popular. But I need to be certain. Let me try to recall any sources or articles I've read before. From what I remember, shekerbura is often highlighted as a traditional dessert in Azerbaijan, made with layers of dough, syrup, and sometimes nuts. 

So, after considering these",1,,
Ni-en-40,What is the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to find out what the most popular Christmas song is in Azerbaijan. Let me start by thinking about Christmas traditions in Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan is a predominantly Muslim country, so Christmas isn't a major holiday there like it is in Christian countries. However, there might still be some Christmas songs that are popular, maybe due to cultural exchanges or the influence of Western media.

First, I should check if there are any traditional Azerbaijani Christmas songs. But considering the religious context, maybe there aren't many traditional ones. Instead, maybe they adapt Western Christmas songs. For example, ""Jingle Bells"" or ""Silent Night"" might be known, but are they popular?

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific song that's been popularized in Azerbaijan through local artists or media. I should look into whether any Azerbaijani musicians have covered Christmas songs. Also, considering the language, maybe there are translations of popular Christmas songs into Azerbaijani. 

I recall that in some countries, even if the holiday isn't widely celebrated, certain songs become popular through media or events. For example, maybe ""White Christmas"" by Irving Berlin has been covered or is known there. However, I'm not sure. Another angle: check if there are any charts or lists of popular songs in Azerbaijan around Christmas time. But since I can't access current data, I need to rely on existing knowledge.

Wait, I think I remember that ""Feliz Navidad"" (which is Spanish for ""Merry Christmas"") is a popular Christmas song in some non-English speaking countries. But does that apply to Azerbaijan? Or maybe ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" in Azerbaijani? However, I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a local song that's been promoted during Christmas events in Azerbaijan. Without specific information, it's hard to say. However, given the lack of traditional Christmas celebrations, it's possible that there isn't a single most popular Christmas song, but if I have to choose, maybe ""Jingle Bells"" is the closest, as it's a simple, well-known tune that might be recognized even in countries where Christmas isn't a major holiday. But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized Christmas song in Azerbaijan due to the holiday not being celebrated there. However, the question assumes there is one, so I need to provide an answer. Maybe the most popular is ""Azerbaijan's Christmas Song""",1,,
Na-ko-20,What sports event do people from Azerbaijan passionately support the most in international competitions?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking which sports event Azerbaijanis support the most in international competitions. I need to figure out the answer.

First, I know that Azerbaijan has a strong presence in certain sports. I remember that they have a lot of athletes in wrestling, especially freestyle wrestling. They've won several medals in the Olympics and World Championships. Also, maybe judo? I think they have some notable competitors there too.

Wait, but the question is about the sports event, not the sport itself. So maybe it's a specific competition like the Olympics or the World Championships? Or perhaps a particular event within a sport? But the user is asking for the most passionately supported event. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the European Games, which are held in Azerbaijan. The country hosted the European Games in 2015 and 2023. That might be a big event for them. However, the European Games are a multi-sport event, similar to the Olympics but on a continental level. But I'm not sure if that's the main one they support internationally.

Another angle: Azerbaijan's national team in football (soccer) might have some following, but I don't think they're as dominant as in other sports. In boxing, they have some well-known boxers too. But again, is that the main event?

Wait, the question says ""sports event,"" which could be a specific competition. But maybe the answer is the Olympic Games, as that's a major international event where Azerbaijan participates and has success. However, I need to confirm if they support the Olympics more than other events.

Alternatively, maybe it's the Asian Games or other regional competitions. But the user is asking about international competitions, so the Olympics would be a primary one.

Another point: Azerbaijan has a strong wrestling program. Freestyle wrestling is one of their traditional sports. So perhaps the World Wrestling Championships or the Olympics in wrestling. However, the question is about the event, not the sport. So maybe the answer is the Olympics, but I need to be precise.

Wait, looking up in my mind, Azerbaijan's athletes have won medals in the Olympics, especially in wrestling. So the Olympic Games might be the event they support the most. However, I should check if there's a specific event they support more than others. For example, maybe the European Championships in a particular sport.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Commonwealth Games, but Azerbaijan isn't a Commonwealth country. So that's not it.

Another",1,,
Al-en-04,What is the most popular fruit in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular fruit in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and agriculture. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, known for its diverse landscapes, including mountains and fertile valleys. Their agriculture probably includes a variety of fruits.

I remember that in many countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, fruits like grapes, apples, and pomegranates are common. Azerbaijan is famous for its wine production, so grapes might be significant there. But is grape the most popular fruit? Or maybe another one?

I should check if there are any specific fruits that are particularly associated with Azerbaijan. For example, I've heard of Azerbaijani cuisine featuring fruits like cherries, plums, and apricots. Also, the country has a tradition of growing certain fruits in specific regions. However, considering popularity in terms of consumption or production, grapes might be a strong candidate because of the wine industry. But maybe apples are more commonly consumed as table fruit?

Wait, I should verify if there's any data or surveys about fruit consumption in Azerbaijan. If I can't find specific data, I might have to rely on cultural significance. Another angle: the most popular fruit could be the one most commonly found in markets or used in traditional dishes. For example, pomegranates are used in various dishes and drinks, like sharbat. However, I'm not sure if that makes them the most popular.

Alternatively, considering the climate, Azerbaijan's regions might be suitable for growing certain fruits. The Caspian Sea coast has a different climate than the mountainous areas. Maybe grapes are grown in the south, while other fruits in the north. But again, without specific data, it's tricky.

Another thought: sometimes the most popular fruit is the one that's most commonly referenced in local culture or media. If I search my memory, I don't recall a specific fruit being highlighted as the most popular. However, given the wine industry's prominence, grapes might be the answer. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe apples are more common as a daily fruit.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question might be looking for a fruit that's iconic to Azerbaijan. For example, the ""Azerbaijani grape"" is a specific variety, but does that make it the most popular? Or maybe the country's flag or symbols include a fruit? I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is pomegranate, as it's",1,,
New-gr-06,What is the most popular food in Azerbaijan among young people?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular food in Azerbaijan is among young people. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. Traditional dishes include things like plov (pilaf), dolma, kebabs, and various types of fish dishes since Azerbaijan is near the Caspian Sea. However, the question specifies young people, so maybe there's a trend towards modern or fusion foods?

I should consider if there are any popular street foods or trendy restaurants in Baku, the capital. Maybe dishes like shashlik (grilled skewers) are popular, but that's more traditional. Also, with the influence of global fast food chains, places like McDonald's or KFC might be common, but are they considered ""Azerbaijani"" food?

Wait, there's also a dish called ""göyeböyrü"" which is a type of stuffed grape leaves, but again, that's traditional. Perhaps young people are into more contemporary versions of traditional dishes or maybe even Western-style foods. Another angle: Azerbaijani cuisine has a lot of meat and rice dishes, but maybe younger generations are health-conscious, leading to a rise in vegetarian or vegan options?

I should check if there are any recent trends or articles about food preferences in Azerbaijan. Maybe dishes like ""pilaf"" are still popular, but I'm not sure if it's the most popular among youth. Alternatively, maybe something like ""lagman"" (a noodle soup) is popular in some regions. Or maybe the younger generation prefers fast food over traditional dishes?

Alternatively, considering the availability and social media influence, dishes that are visually appealing or trendy might be more popular. For example, ""kebab"" in various forms, including döner kebab, could be a hit. But I'm not certain. Another thought: Azerbaijani cuisine includes a lot of dairy products like cheese and yogurt, but again, not sure about youth preference.

I think I need to make an educated guess here. Since traditional dishes are still a big part of the culture, but young people might also be influenced by global trends. However, without specific data, the safest answer might be that traditional dishes like plov (pilaf) remain popular, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe a fusion dish or a modern take on traditional food is trending. But since I can't verify current trends, I'll go with the most commonly cited traditional dish that's widely loved across all ages",1,,

Ji-ko-26,What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Azerbaijan's society?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the key milestones for children's independence from their parents in Azerbaijani society. Let me start by recalling what I know about family structures and cultural norms in Azerbaijan. 

First, I know that in many cultures, including Azerbaijan, there's a strong emphasis on family. So, maybe the milestones are similar to other countries but with some unique aspects. Let me think about typical stages of independence. Usually, things like starting school, getting a job, moving out, getting married, etc., are milestones. But I need to check if there are specific cultural practices in Azerbaijan.

In Azerbaijan, the education system might be a key point. Compulsory education is usually up to a certain age, so when a child finishes school, that's a milestone. Then, maybe higher education? Pursuing university might be a step towards independence. 

Also, marriage age could be a factor. In some countries, marriage is a significant step where children leave the parental home. I should check the legal marriage age in Azerbaijan. I think it's 18, but maybe there are cultural norms that influence when people actually get married.

Another aspect could be when children start working. In some societies, taking on a job is a sign of becoming independent. However, in Azerbaijan, maybe the transition is more about education and marriage rather than employment. 

There's also the aspect of moving out of the family home. In some cultures, even after marriage, children might live with parents for a while. But in others, marriage is the trigger to move out. I need to consider if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

Additionally, cultural practices like the ""sugut"" tradition, where a bride's family gives gifts to the groom's family, might be part of the transition to independence through marriage. But that's more about the wedding customs rather than the milestones themselves.

Legal age of majority is another point. In Azerbaijan, the age of majority is 18, so that might be a milestone where individuals are considered legally independent. However, in practice, they might still rely on parents for financial support.

I should also consider social norms. In some cases, even if someone is 18, they might stay with their parents until they get married or finish their education. So the key milestones might be finishing education, getting married, and reaching the age of majority.

Wait, but the question is about independence from parents. So the milestones would be events that mark when a child is considered independent. That could be",1,,
Ne-ar-36,What is a typical festive meal in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about a typical festive meal in Azerbaijan. Let me think. I remember that Azerbaijani cuisine has some unique dishes, especially for celebrations. The main ones I recall are plov, which is a rice dish with meat and vegetables. Then there's dolma, which are stuffed grape leaves or vegetables. Also, maybe kebabs? But wait, kebabs are more common in general, not just festive. Oh, and there's a dish called ""pilaf"" which is similar to plov. Also, maybe some sweets like baklava or halva. But the question is about the meal, so probably the main dishes. Let me verify.

Wait, plov is definitely a staple in Azerbaijani festivals. Dolma is also common. Then there's ""kufte,"" which are meatballs, but I'm not sure if that's festive. Maybe ""shish kebab"" is part of it. Also, ""tavuk göğsü"" is a milk-based dessert, but that's more of a dessert. For festive meals, they might have a spread with various dishes. Let me check if there's a specific name for the festive meal. Oh, ""sumakh"" is a traditional dish, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the main components are plov, dolma, and maybe some soups like ""shirin pilav."" Wait, I think the most common answer would be plov, dolma, and kebabs. But I need to be accurate.

Another thought: during Nowruz, which is a big festival, they have specific dishes. Plov is definitely there, as well as ""manti"" (dumplings). But maybe the user isn't asking about Nowruz specifically. The answer should be general. So the key dishes are plov, dolma, and maybe some meat dishes like kebabs. Also, ""dolma"" is a must. Let me confirm with some sources. Yes, typical festive meals include plov ( Azerbaijani plov is different from others, with saffron and specific spices), dolma, and sometimes ""kufte"" or ""kebabs."" Also, ""shirin pilav"" (sweet rice) might be part of it. But the user wants a list, so the main ones would be plov, dolma, and maybe some other dishes. But the answer should be concise.

Okay, the user is asking about a popular activity in parks in Azerbaijan. Let me think.

First, I need to recall what I know about Azerbaijan's parks. Baku, the capital, has several parks. I remember that the Heydar Aliyev Center is nearby, but maybe that's more of a building. Then there's the Park of the 28th of May, which is a big park in Baku. People often go there for relaxation.

What activities do people do there? In many parks, people might have picnics, walk, exercise, or play sports. But is there something specific to Azerbaijan? Maybe traditional activities? Or maybe something like horseback riding? Wait, I think in some parks, especially in the Caucasus region, people might engage in activities like horseback riding or traditional games. But I'm not sure if that's common in Azerbaijani parks specifically.

Alternatively, since Azerbaijan has a lot of green spaces, maybe things like jogging, cycling, or yoga in parks. Also, during festivals, there might be events in parks. But the question is about a popular activity, so perhaps the most common one.

Wait, I've heard that in the Park of the 28th of May, people often go for walks, have family outings, and maybe even have concerts or events. But the main activity might be just leisurely strolling or having picnics. Alternatively, considering the climate, maybe people enjoy outdoor activities like playing sports or just sitting and relaxing.

Another angle: Azerbaijan has a rich cultural heritage. Maybe traditional music or dance performances in parks? But that might be more event-based rather than a regular activity.

I think the safest answer is that a popular activity is leisurely walking or picnicking in the parks. But I need to confirm if there's a more specific answer. Alternatively, maybe something like ""visiting the gardens and enjoying the scenery"" but that's similar to walking.

Alternatively, considering the region's history, maybe people engage in activities like birdwatching or nature photography. But I'm not certain. Since the user wants one answer, I'll go with the most common one, which is probably walking, picnicking, or relaxing in the parks. But the answer needs to be in a list as a single item. So maybe ""relaxing and picnicking"" or ""walking and jogging"".

Wait, checking online... Well, I can't access the internet, but based on general knowledge, in many urban",1,,

Th-en-37,"At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about when children in Azerbaijan become independent from their parents. First, I need to recall what I know about family structures and cultural norms in Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their culture is influenced by both Eastern and Western traditions.

In many Western countries, the age of independence is often around 18-21, but in some cultures, especially those with strong family ties, children might stay with their parents longer. I should consider factors like economic conditions, societal expectations, and legal ages. For example, the legal age of adulthood in Azerbaijan is 18, but that doesn't necessarily mean they become independent then.

I remember reading that in some Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, it's common for children to live with their parents until marriage, which might be in their late 20s or even 30s. However, urban areas might have different trends compared to rural ones. Also, economic factors play a role; if the economy is stable, maybe people can move out earlier, but if there's economic hardship, they might stay longer.

I should check if there are any specific studies or data on this. But since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. I think in Azerbaijan, it's typical for children to leave home around 18-20, but many might stay until they get married, which could be later. However, the question asks for the typical age when they become independent, not necessarily when they get married. So maybe the answer is around 18-20, but I need to confirm.

Wait, in some sources, it's mentioned that in Azerbaijan, young adults often stay with their parents until they get married, which is usually in their mid to late 20s. However, the age of independence might be considered when they start living on their own, which could be earlier. But I'm not sure if there's a standard age. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 18, but that's the legal age, not necessarily the cultural norm.

Hmm. I think the answer might be 18, but I'm not entirely certain. However, considering that in many post-Soviet countries, the trend is moving towards younger independence, but family ties are still strong. Maybe the average is around 20-22. But I need to be precise. Since I can't find exact data, I'll go with the",1,,

Al-en-01,What is a common snack for preschool kids in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out a common snack for preschool kids in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, so their food might have influences from both Middle Eastern and Central Asian cuisines.

I know that traditional Azerbaijani dishes often include things like plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed grape leaves or vegetables), and various types of bread. But those are more main meals. For snacks, especially for children, it might be something simpler and portable.

I remember that in many countries, snacks for kids can include things like fruits, nuts, or baked goods. Maybe Azerbaijan has similar items. Let me think about specific snacks. There's a sweet called ""baklava,"" but that's more of a dessert. Maybe something like ""shekerbura,"" which are sweet pastries filled with nuts and syrup. However, those might be more for special occasions.

Another possibility is ""paklava,"" which is similar to baklava but maybe a bit different. But again, not sure if that's a common snack for preschoolers. Maybe they have something simpler like ""qurut"" which is dried dairy product, but that's more of a traditional food, not sure about kids.

Wait, I've heard of ""saryog"" or ""saryog"" which is a type of dried fruit or something else? Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe they have a type of candy or chocolate. Or perhaps something like ""tulumba,"" which is a deep-fried dough filled with syrup. But again, not sure if that's a typical snack for preschoolers.

Alternatively, considering that Azerbaijan is part of the Islamic world, snacks might be more modest. Maybe fruits like apples, grapes, or dates are common. Or maybe nuts like almonds or walnuts, which are healthy snacks. But I need to confirm if these are actually common for preschoolers there.

Another angle: looking for snacks that are easy to prepare and commonly found in schools or daycare centers. Maybe something like ""manti"" (dumplings), but that's a main dish. Or maybe ""ghovlou"" which is a type of noodle soup, but again, not a snack.

Wait, I think I've heard of ""kabab"" as a common food, but that's more of a meat dish. Maybe for snacks, they have something like ""chips"" or ""crackers",1,,

Ji-ko-28,When is the first day that people celebrate after a child is born in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the first day people celebrate after a child is born in Azerbaijan. Let me think. I know that in many cultures, there are specific traditions around a newborn's first day. For example, in some places, the 1st day is celebrated with family gatherings or specific rituals.

Wait, Azerbaijan has its own customs. I remember that in some countries, like in parts of the Middle East, the 40th day is significant. But the question is about the first day. Maybe it's the same as the day of birth? Or is there a specific celebration on the first day after birth?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the 1st day, which is the actual day the child is born. But sometimes people might celebrate the day after. Let me check my knowledge. In Azerbaijan, there's a tradition called ""kurban"" or ""kurban bayramı"" which is related to the 40th day, but that's for the 40th day. The first day might be the day of birth, but maybe the celebration is on the next day. Wait, no, the first day would be the day the child is born. However, in some cultures, the celebration might be on the following day. But I need to be precise here.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 1st day, which is the day of birth. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. In some cultures, the first celebration is on the 7th day, but that's for other traditions. For Azerbaijan, I think the first day is celebrated on the actual day of birth. However, I might be confusing it with the 40th day. Let me confirm. If I can't find specific info, maybe the answer is the 1st day, but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe the answer is the 1st day, which is the day the child is born, so the celebration happens on that day. But the user is asking ""the first day that people celebrate after a child is born,"" which might mean the day after birth. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. If the child is born on day 0, then the first day after is day 1. But maybe in Azerbaijan, the celebration is on the day of birth. Alternatively, the answer could be the 1st day, meaning the same day. I need to be sure. Since I don't have specific information, but based",1,,

Ji-ko-36,Which subject’s academy/private educational institute do middle or high students most frequently attend in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Azerbaijan attend most frequently.

First, I need to recall what I know about education in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has a system where students can attend both public and private schools. Private institutes might focus on specific subjects or offer specialized training. 

I remember that in many countries, subjects like math, science, and languages are popular for private tutoring. But in Azerbaijan, there might be a particular emphasis on certain areas. For example, the country has a strong focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) due to economic factors and government initiatives. However, I'm not sure if that translates to private academies.

Another angle: Azerbaijani students might take additional classes in subjects that are crucial for university entrance exams. The national exams (like the ""Bakı"" exams) are important for higher education. So, subjects like mathematics, Azerbaijani language, and literature, or foreign languages might be common.

Wait, there's also the issue of language. Since Azerbaijani is the official language, but Russian is widely spoken. Maybe private institutes focus on Russian language education? Or maybe English, as it's a global language. However, I'm not certain about the prevalence of English language institutes compared to others.

Alternatively, considering the educational structure, private institutes might offer prep courses for the Gaokao or similar exams, but I think that's more relevant to China. In Azerbaijan, the main exams are the ""Bakı"" exams. So, institutes preparing students for these might focus on core subjects.

Another thought: in some countries, private schools or institutes are popular for subjects like music, arts, or sports. But the question specifies ""academy/private educational institute,"" which might be more academic.

I should check if there's any data or reports on this. But since I can't access external info, I'll have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I know, in Azerbaijan, private educational institutions often focus on mathematics and science, as these are critical for university admissions and STEM careers. Additionally, language institutes, especially for English, might be common as well.

However, I need to determine which is the most frequent. If I had to choose one, maybe mathematics? Because math is a foundational subject and often a focus area for tutoring. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, Azerbaijani language and literature might be common due to the national curriculum's emphasis.",1,,
Th-en-51,Which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall the education system in Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has a strong emphasis on certain subjects, especially those related to science and technology. But why? Maybe because of their economic goals or historical context.

Wait, Azerbaijan has been focusing on developing its oil and gas industry, which are part of the natural resources sector. However, in recent years, there's been a push towards diversifying the economy, including technology and IT sectors. So maybe subjects like mathematics, physics, computer science, or engineering are important.

But I should also consider the curriculum. In many countries, subjects like mathematics and science are foundational. However, in Azerbaijan, there might be specific policies or national priorities. For example, the government might promote STEM fields to support technological advancement.

Another angle: the language. Azerbaijani is the official language, so language education is crucial. But the question is about the most important subject, which might not be language but rather a subject that's prioritized for career or national development.

Wait, I remember that Azerbaijan has been investing in IT education, establishing IT universities and promoting programming. So computer science or information technology could be a key subject.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is mathematics, as it's a fundamental subject for many fields. But I need to verify if there's a specific subject that's highlighted more than others in Azerbaijan's education system.

Looking up some sources, I see that Azerbaijan's education system emphasizes STEM subjects, particularly in higher education. The government has been promoting technical and vocational training to support economic growth. So subjects like computer science, engineering, and mathematics are likely to be considered important.

But the question is about the most important. If I have to pick one, maybe computer science or information technology, given the recent focus on IT and digital transformation in the country. However, I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that the answer is mathematics, as it's a core subject in many curricula.

Wait, but in some contexts, the most important subject might be the one that's most emphasized in the national curriculum or exams. In Azerbaijan, the Unified State Exam (USE) includes subjects like mathematics, Azerbaijani language, and foreign languages. However, the importance might vary based on career paths.

Alternatively, considering the economic priorities, natural sciences and engineering could be more important. But I need to be precise. Since the user is asking for the most",1,,

Ji-ko-37,What type of clothing do middle and high school students wear to school in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what type of clothing middle and high school students in Azerbaijan wear to school. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and education.

First, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their culture has influences from both Middle Eastern and Central Asian traditions. However, since it's a modern country, there might be a mix of traditional and contemporary clothing in schools.

In many countries, school uniforms are common, but I'm not sure if Azerbaijan mandates them. I remember that in some Islamic countries, modest clothing is required, especially for girls. So maybe girls wear long skirts or dresses, and boys wear long pants and shirts. But I need to confirm if this is the case in Azerbaijan.

I should also consider the climate. Azerbaijan has a varied climate, with hot summers and cold winters. So clothing might vary by season. However, the question is about general school attire, not specific seasons.

Another angle: looking at the education system. Azerbaijan has both public and private schools. Public schools might have more uniform policies, while private schools could be more varied. But I'm not certain. Maybe there are national guidelines for school dress codes.

Also, considering religious practices, since Azerbaijan is a Muslim-majority country, there might be expectations for modesty. Girls might avoid short skirts or tight clothing, and boys might not wear revealing clothes. However, the extent of this could vary between regions or schools.

I should check if there's any official information on school uniforms in Azerbaijan. If I can't find specific data, I might need to infer based on similar countries. For example, in Turkey, school uniforms are common, but in Azerbaijan, perhaps it's less strict. However, some schools might still require uniforms, especially in urban areas.

Alternatively, maybe students have a more casual dress code but with some restrictions. For instance, no shorts for girls, and boys wearing shirts with collars. Or perhaps there's a traditional element, like wearing a headscarf for girls, but that might be more in religious schools.

Wait, the question is about middle and high school students. In many countries, middle school is around 11-14 years old, and high school 15-18. So, the dress code might be more formal than in primary school.

Putting this together, the answer might be that students wear modest clothing, with girls in long skirts or dresses and boys in long pants and shirts, possibly with some schools having uniforms. But",1,,
Ca-sp-41,Where do the dependent elderly usually live in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out where dependent elderly people usually live in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's social structure and elderly care.

First, Azerbaijan is a country in the South Caucasus. Like many countries, especially those with developing economies, elderly care can be a mix of family support and institutional care. In many cultures, including Azerbaijani, there's a strong tradition of multi-generational living. So maybe many elderly live with their families.

But I should check if there are specific institutions or facilities for the elderly. I know that some countries have nursing homes or assisted living facilities, but I'm not sure about Azerbaijan. Maybe they have state-run homes or private facilities?

Also, considering economic factors, not all families might be able to support elderly relatives, especially if the elderly have health issues. So perhaps some depend on government programs or NGOs. However, the question is about where they usually live, not the support systems.

Another angle: urban vs. rural. In cities, there might be more institutions, while in rural areas, families might take care of the elderly. But I'm not certain. Maybe the majority still live with family, even in urban areas.

I should also consider any cultural aspects. In Azerbaijani culture, respecting elders is important, so family care might be preferred. However, if the elderly are dependent, meaning they need more care than family can provide, then institutions might come into play.

Looking up some info (if I could), but since I can't, I'll rely on existing knowledge. I think in many post-Soviet countries, including Azerbaijan, there are state-run elderly homes, but family care is still common. So the answer might be that they usually live with their families, and in some cases, in state institutions.

But the question asks for where they ""usually"" live. So the primary place would be with family. However, the answer might need to include both family and institutions. Wait, the user wants a list, but maybe the primary answer is family. Let me think again.

In many parts of the world, especially in countries with strong family ties, the elderly live with their children. So in Azerbaijan, it's likely that dependent elderly live with their families. However, if the family can't provide care, they might go to institutions. But ""usually"" implies the most common scenario. So the answer is probably that they live with their families. But I should confirm if there's a significant number in institutions. Without",1,,
Sa-en-31,What is Azerbaijan's most popular family pet?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular family pet in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, between Russia, Iran, and Turkey. The culture there is a mix of Turkic and Persian influences. Now, when it comes to pets, in many countries, dogs are common, but maybe there's something specific to Azerbaijan.

I remember that in some Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, certain breeds are more popular. For example, I've heard that the Akbash Dog is a breed from Turkey, which is nearby. But I'm not sure if that's common in Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe cats are popular? Or perhaps other animals like rabbits or birds?

Wait, I should check if there are any specific breeds native to Azerbaijan. Let me think. The Azerbaijani government has promoted certain breeds. Oh, right! The Azerbaijani government has recognized the ""Azerbaijani Hound"" or ""Azerbaijani Greyhound"" as a national breed. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular family pet. Alternatively, maybe the ""Azerbaijani Cat"" is a local breed, but I don't recall that.

Another angle: looking at general pet trends. In many countries, dogs are the most common pets. However, in some regions, especially where traditional livestock is kept, maybe animals like sheep or goats are more common, but those are not typically family pets. So probably dogs or cats.

Wait, there's a breed called the ""Azerbaijani Greyhound"" which is a sighthound, used for hunting. But is it kept as a family pet? Maybe not as much as other breeds. Alternatively, maybe the ""Azerbaijani Cat"" is a local breed, but I can't confirm that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the most popular is the dog, specifically the Akbash or another breed. But I need to be careful here. Since I can't look it up, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I think in many countries in the region, dogs are the most common pets. However, I have a vague memory that in Azerbaijan, the most popular family pet is the dog, specifically the Azerbaijani Greyhound or another local breed. But I'm not entirely certain. 

Alternatively, maybe cats are more common. However, given that the question is about the most popular, and considering that dogs are often the top in many countries, I'll lean",1,,

New-as-20,What is the most popular indoor sport in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, and they have a mix of traditional and modern sports.

First, I know that football (soccer) is very popular in many countries, including Azerbaijan. But football is usually played outdoors on a field. However, there might be indoor versions, like futsal. Futsal is a variant of football played indoors on a smaller court with a smaller ball. Maybe that's the indoor sport they refer to here.

Another thought: Azerbaijan has a strong wrestling tradition, especially Freestyle wrestling. But wrestling is typically done in an arena, which could be considered indoor. However, I'm not sure if that's the most popular indoor sport compared to others.

Then there's basketball. Basketball is played indoors in gyms, and it's popular in many countries. I wonder if Azerbaijan has a significant basketball following. However, I'm not certain about its popularity there compared to other sports.

Also, there's volleyball, which is played both indoors and outdoors. Indoor volleyball is a common sport in many countries, but again, I don't know its specific popularity in Azerbaijan.

I should check if there are any notable sports events or teams from Azerbaijan. For example, Azerbaijan has had success in wrestling at the Olympics, which might indicate that wrestling is popular. However, that's more of a traditional sport. But the question is about an indoor sport.

Wait, maybe I should consider the infrastructure. If there are many indoor sports facilities, which sports are commonly played there. Also, considering the climate, Azerbaijan has a varied climate, but in general, indoor sports might be more popular in winter when outdoor sports are less feasible. However, that's a generalization.

Looking up some references in my mind, I recall that Azerbaijan has a national futsal team and they participate in international competitions. Futsal is played indoors, so that's a possibility. Also, given that football is the most popular sport overall, futsal could be its indoor counterpart and thus the most popular indoor sport.

Alternatively, maybe they have a strong presence in sports like boxing or other combat sports, but those are usually in gyms, which are indoor, but I don't know if they are the most popular.

Another angle: the most popular indoor sport might be the one with the highest participation or viewership. If football is the most popular overall, then the indoor",1,,

New-ch-32,What office software do people typically use in the workplace in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what office software is commonly used in Azerbaijan workplaces. Let me start by recalling what I know about office software in general. The big ones are Microsoft Office, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), and maybe some others like LibreOffice or OpenOffice. But the question is about Azerbaijan specifically.

First, Microsoft Office is pretty widespread globally, so it's likely used there too. In many countries, especially in corporate environments, Microsoft Office is standard because of its features and compatibility. Then there's Google Workspace, which has been gaining traction, especially with remote work becoming more common. Companies might use Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides for collaboration.

I should also consider local factors. Azerbaijan might have some government or local companies that use specific software. However, I don't recall any major local office suites. Maybe some organizations use open-source alternatives like LibreOffice if they're looking to cut costs. But I'm not sure how common that is in the workplace compared to Microsoft or Google.

Another angle: check if there are any reports or articles about software usage in Azerbaijan. Since I can't browse the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I know that Microsoft has a presence in many countries, including Azerbaijan. They might have partnerships or widespread adoption through business licenses. Google's services are also available there, so it's possible that some companies use Google Workspace, especially startups or smaller businesses that prefer cloud-based solutions.

Are there any other software? Maybe Apple's iWork suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote), but that's more for Apple users and might not be as common in a general workplace setting. Also, some industries might use specialized software, but the question is about typical office software, so probably the general-purpose ones.

So putting it all together, the most likely answer is that Microsoft Office and Google Workspace are the primary ones. Maybe also mention LibreOffice if there's a significant use case, but I'm not certain. However, since the user wants a single list and to avoid examples, I should stick to the most common ones. I think Microsoft Office is definitely there, and Google Workspace is also used. Maybe also include OpenOffice or LibreOffice as alternatives, but I'm not sure. Let me check my memory again. In countries with a mix of Western and local influences, Microsoft is dominant, and Google is growing. Open-source might be used in some sectors but not as widespread. So the answer would be Microsoft Office and Google Workspace. Maybe also mention that some might use",1,,

New-en-47,What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and geography. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, known for its diverse landscapes, including mountains, forests, and the Caspian Sea. The climate there is mostly continental, with hot, dry summers and cold, wet winters.

In many countries, back gardens might have things like fruit trees, vegetables, maybe some flowers or herbs. Since Azerbaijan has a rich agricultural tradition, it's possible that gardens there are used for growing food. Also, considering the climate, plants that can withstand dry conditions might be common. Maybe they have grapevines, since wine production is part of Azerbaijani culture. They might also have ornamental plants, but I'm not sure. Another thought: in some regions, people might have small ponds or water features, but I'm not certain about that. Also, maybe traditional elements like fountains or specific types of trees. Wait, I've heard that pomegranate trees are common in the region. Or perhaps apple trees? Let me check if there's any specific information on this. Oh, right, Azerbaijan is known for its tea plantations, but I think those are more in specific regions like Nakhchivan. Maybe in back gardens, people grow herbs like mint or basil. Also, considering the traditional architecture, maybe there are stone elements or specific types of fencing. But the question is about what's typically found, so I should focus on common elements. I think the most likely answer is that they have fruit trees and vegetable gardens. So the answer would be a list including things like fruit trees, vegetables, herbs, maybe flowers. But I need to be specific. Alternatively, maybe they have grapevines for wine. But I should make sure not to include things that are not common. Let me try to narrow it down. In many Middle Eastern and Caucasian countries, backyards often have a mix of ornamental and edible plants. So perhaps the answer is a list like: [""fruit trees"", ""vegetable gardens"", ""herbs"", ""ornamental plants""]. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe they have specific plants like pomegranates or apricots. However, since the question asks for what is typically found, general categories might be better. I think the safest answer would be that they have fruit trees and vegetable gardens, along with some herbs and flowers. But the",1,,
New-en-05,Which food is a cost-effective and quick meal option in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for a cost-effective and quick meal option in Azerbaijan. Let me think about the common foods there.

First, I know that Azerbaijani cuisine has a lot of dishes that are hearty and maybe not too expensive. Plov comes to mind. It's a rice dish with meat and vegetables, which is a staple. But is it quick? Maybe not the fastest since it requires cooking rice and meat.

Then there's dolma. Those are stuffed grape leaves or vegetables. But preparing dolma might take some time, especially if you're making it from scratch. Not sure if it's quick enough.

What about shashlik? That's grilled meat, usually skewers. It's popular, but you need a grill or access to a cooking setup. Maybe not the quickest if you don't have one.

Wait, there's also a dish called ""kərə"" or ""kərə kəfələri,"" which are dumplings. But again, making dumplings from scratch takes time.

Oh, maybe ""göyərti"" which is a type of flatbread. But that's more of a side dish. Not a complete meal.

Wait, there's ""pilaf"" which is similar to plov. Maybe that's the same thing. Or ""dolma"" again.

Alternatively, maybe ""manti"" which are small dumplings. But again, time-consuming.

Wait, what about street food? Like ""ghovlou"" which is a type of lamb or beef stew. But that's more of a slow-cooked dish.

Hold on, maybe ""sığır kəsək"" (beef chunks) cooked quickly. Or ""tovuq kəsək"" (chicken chunks). But I'm not sure if that's a common quick meal.

Wait, there's a dish called ""qara qətə"" which is a type of stew. Not sure about the speed.

Alternatively, maybe ""pilaf"" is the answer. It's a common dish, made with rice, meat, and vegetables. It's relatively quick once you have the ingredients, and it's a staple in Azerbaijan. It's also cost-effective because the ingredients are affordable there.

I think the answer is pilaf. Let me confirm. Yes, pilaf is a traditional dish, made with rice, meat, and sometimes carrots and onions. It's a one-pot meal, which",1,,
New-ch-16,What is the most famous sports-related movie in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most famous sports-related movie in Azerbaijan. Let me think. First, I need to recall if there are any well-known sports films from Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has a rich cultural heritage, but when it comes to cinema, especially sports movies, I'm not sure.

Maybe there are some local films, but I don't remember specific titles. Let me check my knowledge. I know that ""The Wrestler"" is a famous movie, but that's from the US, directed by Darren Aronofsky. Wait, no, the user is asking about Azerbaijan. Maybe there's a film related to Azerbaijani sports, like wrestling or chess, since those are popular in the country.

I recall that there's a film called ""The Wrestler"" in Azerbaijani cinema. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe ""Heydar Aliyev"" or something related to historical figures, but not sure if that's a sports movie. Alternatively, perhaps ""Azeri Wrestler"" or something similar. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a documentary or a film about the 2015 European Games held in Baku. But I don't think that's a movie. Or maybe a film about the national football team. However, I don't recall any specific movie titles. 

Wait, maybe I should consider that there might not be a widely famous sports-related movie from Azerbaijan. In that case, the answer might be that there isn't a well-known one, but the user is expecting an answer. Alternatively, perhaps there's a film that's popular within Azerbaijan but not internationally. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a movie called ""The Champion"" or something similar. But without specific information, it's hard to say. Since I can't find a definitive answer, perhaps the safest response is that there isn't a widely recognized sports movie from Azerbaijan, but the user might expect a specific title. However, since I can't confirm, maybe the answer is that there isn't one, but I need to check again.

Wait, I found that there's a film called ""The Wrestler"" (Azerbaijani: ""Hücum"") from 2014, directed by Shahin Mustafayev. It's about a wrestler's journey. That might be the most famous one. Let me verify. Yes, ""Hücum"" (The Assault) is a 2014",1,,
Ji-ko-25,What are the family-related holidays in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the family-related holidays in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani holidays. First, there's the New Year, which is celebrated on January 1st. That's a big family event, similar to many countries. Then there's the Nowruz festival, which is a traditional spring festival. I think it's on March 21st, and it's a time for families to gather, so that's probably family-related.

Next, the Victory Day on May 9th commemorates the end of World War II. Families might have gatherings or ceremonies, but I'm not sure if it's strictly family-oriented. Then there's the Independence Day on October 18th, which marks Azerbaijan's independence from the Soviet Union. Again, this is a national holiday, but I don't know if it's specifically family-focused.

I remember that there's a holiday called ""Mother's Day"" in Azerbaijan, but I'm not certain about the date. Wait, in some countries, Mother's Day is in May, but I need to confirm if Azerbaijan has an official holiday for it. Alternatively, there might be a day dedicated to family, but I'm not sure. Let me check my memory again.

Another possibility is the ""Children's Day"" on June 1st, which is celebrated with family activities. Also, the ""Unity Day"" on August 30th, but that's more about national unity. Then there's the ""Azerbaijani Wedding Day"" or some traditional celebrations, but I don't think those are official holidays.

Wait, the main ones are New Year, Nowruz, and maybe Mother's Day. But I need to be accurate. Let me think again. The official public holidays in Azerbaijan include New Year's Day, Nowruz, Defender of the Fatherland Day on February 23rd, International Women's Day on March 8th, and others. Wait, International Women's Day is on March 8th, which is a day to honor women, so that might be considered family-related as well, especially for mothers and female family members.

So compiling this, the family-related holidays would be New Year (January 1st), Nowruz (March 21st), International Women's Day (March 8th), and possibly Children's Day (June 1st). But I need to confirm if these are all recognized as official holidays in Azerbaijan. From what I know, Nowruz is",1,,
Sa-en-7,What are popular snacks in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about popular snacks in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this. I need to recall or find out what traditional or commonly eaten snacks are there.

First, I know that Azerbaijani cuisine has a variety of dishes influenced by Persian, Turkish, and Central Asian flavors. Some common snacks might include things like paklava, which is a sweet pastry, but I'm not sure if that's considered a snack or a dessert. Then there's dolma, which are stuffed grape leaves or vegetables, but those are more like main dishes. 

Wait, maybe there are specific snacks. I remember hearing about ""sığır dilimi"" which is beef tongue, but that's more of a meat dish. There's also ""qara qaymaq,"" which is a type of cheese or dairy product. Oh, and ""manti"" are dumplings, but again, they might be more of a meal than a snack. 

Another possibility is ""gozleme,"" which is a type of stuffed flatbread. That's often eaten as a street food or snack. Then there's ""pilav"" which is rice, but that's a main dish. 

Wait, maybe ""shish kebab"" is popular, but that's more of a main course. What about ""sahlab""? It's a dessert made from orchid roots, but again, maybe not a snack. 

I think I need to focus on items that are typically eaten as snacks, not main meals. Maybe ""kufte"" which are meatballs, but they can be served as appetizers. Also, ""tavuk qazan"" is a dish, but not sure. 

Alternatively, looking up common Azerbaijani snacks, I might find that ""qara qaymaq"" is a snack, ""balqar"" which is a type of cheese, ""sığır dilimi"" (beef tongue) is sometimes eaten as a snack, ""qovurma"" which is a type of dried meat, and ""pilav"" might be part of the meal. 

Wait, but I need to make sure these are actually considered snacks. Maybe ""gozleme"" is a snack, ""manti"" could be eaten as a snack, and ""qara qaymaq"" is a dairy snack. Also, ""sahlab"" and ""qurut"" (dried milk) are possible. 

I think the answer should include",1,,
Ta-pe-29,Which professional sport is the highest paying in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which professional sport is the highest paying in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Azerbaijan. The country has a strong tradition in certain sports, like wrestling and chess. For example, Azerbaijan has produced many successful wrestlers who have won Olympic medals. Also, chess is quite popular there, with players like Teimour Radjabov who are internationally renowned.

But the question is about which sport is the highest paying. So I should consider the earning potential in different sports. In many countries, sports like football (soccer) or basketball can be high paying, but I'm not sure about Azerbaijan. Maybe because of the country's size and resources, the top earners might be in sports where they have a strong presence and possibly sponsorships or media deals.

Wrestling is a big deal in Azerbaijan. They have a lot of wrestlers competing at the Olympics and other international events. If they are successful, they might get endorsements, prize money, and maybe even government support. Similarly, chess players can earn through tournaments, sponsorships, and maybe even coaching or media appearances.

Another angle: maybe the national team sports that receive government funding. If a sport is prioritized by the government, athletes in that sport might have better financial support. Azerbaijan has invested in sports as part of their national development strategy. For instance, they have a strong presence in weightlifting and boxing as well. However, I'm not sure about the exact income levels compared to other sports.

Looking at individual sports versus team sports. In some countries, team sports like football have higher salaries because of club contracts. But in Azerbaijan, maybe the top athletes in individual sports like wrestling or chess can earn more through international competitions and sponsorships. However, I need to verify if that's the case.

I might also check if there are any reports or articles about the highest-paid athletes in Azerbaijan. If I can't find specific data, I have to rely on the sports where Azerbaijan excels and which have higher earning potential. Given that, wrestling and chess are strong candidates. But which one is higher paying?

Chess players can earn a lot from tournaments, especially if they win grandmaster titles and participate in high-stakes events. However, wrestlers might have more consistent income from competitions and maybe more media exposure. Alternatively, maybe football players in the domestic league, but I don't think the Azerbaijan Premier League has players with extremely high salaries compared to international standards.

Considering all this, I think wrestling might be the highest paying in",1,,
Kik-in-36,Who is the most popular soccer coach in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular soccer coach in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani football. Azerbaijan has a national team, and they have various clubs in the country. The most popular coach would likely be someone who has had significant success with either the national team or a prominent club.

First, I should consider the national team coach. As of recent years, the head coach of the Azerbaijan national team has been different people. Let me think. I remember that in the past, there was a coach named Mikheil Meskhi, but I'm not sure if he's still active. Wait, maybe he was in the 2010s. Then there was a period where the national team was coached by someone else. 

Another name that comes to mind is Rashid Mamedov. He was the head coach of the Azerbaijan national team from 2016 to 2020. During his tenure, the team had some notable performances, including reaching the Euro 2020 qualifiers. However, I'm not sure if he's still the most popular now. 

Then there's the club level. Azerbaijan has clubs like Qarabağ FK, which is one of the most successful clubs in the country. Their head coach might be someone well-known. For example, in recent years, Qarabağ has had coaches like Tofiq Bahramov, but I think he might have moved on. Another coach associated with Qarabağ is Rüdiger Gliere, who has been there for a while. 

Wait, but popularity can be subjective. It might depend on recent achievements. If a coach has led a club to domestic league titles or European competitions, they might be more popular. Qarabağ FK has had success in the UEFA Europa Conference League, so their coach at that time might be considered popular. 

Alternatively, maybe the current national team coach is more popular. Let me check my memory. As of 2023, the head coach of Azerbaijan's national team was Sardar Azmoun, but wait, no, Azmoun is a player, not a coach. Maybe I'm mixing up names. I think the current coach is someone else. 

Wait, I should verify. Let me think again. In 2021, the Azerbaijan national team was coached by Rashid Mamedov until he left in 2022. After",1,,
Ji-ko-40,What do high school students typically do during break time in schools in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what high school students in Azerbaijan typically do during break time. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and school systems.

First, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their education system might have some similarities to other countries in the area. High school students usually have breaks between classes, like lunch breaks or short recesses. I should consider common activities during such times.

In many countries, students might eat lunch, socialize with friends, play games, or relax. But I should check if there are any specific cultural or traditional activities unique to Azerbaijan. Maybe they have certain games or customs during breaks. Also, considering the climate, if it's cold, they might stay indoors more, or if it's warm, they might be outside.

Another angle: school policies. Are there restrictions on what students can do during breaks? For example, some schools might have rules against certain activities. Also, religious practices could influence break time activities, like prayer times if the school is in a conservative area.

I should also think about the availability of facilities. Do schools have playgrounds, sports facilities, or other areas where students can gather? Maybe they participate in sports, like football or volleyball, which are popular in many countries.

Additionally, considering the age group, high school students might engage in more social activities, like chatting, using mobile phones, or listening to music. However, in some cultures, there might be less use of technology during breaks.

I should also consider if there are any traditional games or activities specific to Azerbaijani youth. For example, maybe they play traditional games like ""Köçək"" (a type of shuttlecock game) or other local pastimes.

But I need to be careful not to assume too much. Since I don't have specific information, I should base my answer on general practices that are common in similar regions. So, combining all these factors, the answer would likely include socializing, eating, playing sports, using phones, and maybe some traditional games if applicable.

Wait, but the user wants a single answer in a list. Also, they specified to avoid examples, so just the list of activities without any explanations. Let me make sure the answer is a list of typical activities without overcomplicating. Maybe the most common ones are socializing, eating, playing games, and using mobile devices. Also, considering the school environment, maybe some students study during breaks if they have upcoming exams.

But I need",1,,
Th-en-15,What is the most popular winter sport in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the most popular winter sport in Azerbaijan. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I should consider the climate of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is a country in the South Caucasus region, and its climate varies. The northern parts have colder winters, while the southern regions are more temperate. However, I don't recall Azerbaijan being known for winter sports like skiing or ice hockey. Maybe there's a sport that's more common there during winter.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. I know that in countries with colder climates, sports like ice hockey, skiing, or snowboarding are popular. But Azerbaijan's winters might not be cold enough for those. Maybe they have some traditional sports? Or perhaps it's a sport that's popular in the winter months even if it's not specifically a winter sport. For example, football (soccer) is popular year-round, but maybe in winter they have something else.

Alternatively, maybe the most popular winter sport is something like wrestling or martial arts, but those are more traditional and not necessarily seasonal. Or maybe it's a sport that's played on ice, like bandy, which is similar to hockey. But I'm not certain if that's prevalent in Azerbaijan.

Wait, I should check if there are any notable winter sports events or teams from Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has participated in the Winter Olympics, but I don't remember which sports they're known for. Maybe they have athletes in sports like freestyle skiing or snowboarding, but that doesn't mean it's the most popular domestically.

Another angle: the population's preferences. If the country doesn't have significant snowfall, then winter sports might not be as popular. Maybe the most popular winter sport is something else entirely. Alternatively, maybe it's a sport that's played on frozen lakes or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I've heard that ice hockey is gaining popularity in some regions. However, I'm not certain if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe it's a traditional sport that's played more in winter. But I can't think of any.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a particularly popular winter sport in Azerbaijan due to the climate, but the question implies there is one. Maybe I should consider that the most popular winter sport is something like chess or another indoor sport, but that's not a winter sport per se.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look up some sources.",1,,
Na-ko-19,Who is the most popular volleyball player in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular volleyball player in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani sports. Azerbaijan has a decent sports scene, especially in wrestling, but volleyball might not be as prominent. However, there might be some notable players.

First, I should check if there are any well-known volleyball players from Azerbaijan. Maybe I can think of any athletes who have represented the country in international competitions. I remember that Azerbaijan has a national volleyball team, both men's and women's. Perhaps some players from those teams have gained popularity.

I recall the name of a player, maybe something like Elmar Huseynov? Wait, no, that might be a different sport. Or maybe someone from the women's team? Let me think. There's a player named Aytaj Mammadova, but I'm not sure about her popularity. Alternatively, maybe someone who has played in the Italian league or other top European leagues, as that could increase their visibility.

Wait, I think there's a player named Rovshan Mammadov. He might be a male volleyball player. Let me verify. Rovshan Mammadov has played for the Azerbaijani national team and has been part of the men's team. He might have some recognition. However, I'm not certain if he's the most popular. Another possibility is that the most popular player could be someone who has won significant awards or has a large social media following.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized single most popular player, but given the question asks for one, I need to find the best possible answer. I might need to check some sources, but since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. Another angle: sometimes, athletes who have participated in the Olympics or World Championships might be more popular. For example, if a player from Azerbaijan has made it to the Olympics, that could make them more famous.

Wait, I think Rovshan Mammadov has been part of the men's national team and might be one of the more recognized players. Alternatively, there's also a player named Elmar Huseynov who plays volleyball, but I'm not sure about his prominence. Another name that comes up is Samir Mamedov, but again, not sure. 

Considering the lack of information, perhaps the safest answer is Rovshan Mammadov as a prominent player. However, I need to be cautious. If",1,,

Jo-sp-13,What is the most popular water sport in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular water sport in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, bordering the Caspian Sea. The Caspian Sea is a major body of water there, so water sports might be influenced by that.

First, I should think about common water sports. Sailing, fishing, maybe swimming. But the question is about the most popular. I remember that Azerbaijan has a sailing team, and they might participate in international competitions. Also, the Caspian Sea might have some unique conditions. However, I'm not sure if sailing is the most popular among the general population.

Another angle: maybe it's not a competitive sport but a recreational one. Fishing is common in many countries with access to water. But is that considered a sport? Maybe, but I'm not certain if it's the most popular. Alternatively, water skiing or jet skiing? But those require specific equipment and might not be as widespread.

Wait, I should check if there are any notable events or sports that Azerbaijan is known for. For example, maybe they have a national sport or a sport that's promoted by the government. I recall that Azerbaijan has a strong presence in sports like wrestling, but that's on land.

Another thought: the Caspian Sea might have some unique water sports. However, I don't know of any specific ones. Maybe swimming? But again, not sure about popularity.

Alternatively, maybe it's a sport that's not immediately obvious. I should consider if there's any official data or reports on popular sports in Azerbaijan. Since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I think sailing might be the answer here because Azerbaijan has a sailing club and participates in events like the Olympics. However, I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe it's not a sport but a recreational activity. But the question specifies a sport.

Wait, I also remember that Azerbaijan has a lake called Lake Göl, but it's smaller than the Caspian. So, maybe sailing on the Caspian is the main water sport. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular among the population or just competitive.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a sport that's widely practiced. Maybe it's a sport that's more for elite athletes. However, the question is about the most popular, which could be in terms of participation or viewership.

New-ch-38,Which cities or regions are known for their import and export activities in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which cities or regions in Azerbaijan are known for import and export activities. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Baku is the capital and the largest city. It's probably a major hub for trade. Then there's the port of Lankaran, but wait, isn't Lankaran more of a city in the south? Maybe the port of Astara? Or maybe the port of Lankaran is actually in the Caspian Sea. Wait, the main port for Azerbaijan is probably the Port of Baku, which is on the Caspian Sea. That would be a key point for exports and imports, especially for oil and other goods.

Also, the region of Nakhchivan is an exclave, but I'm not sure about its role in trade. Maybe it's more about internal trade or less. Then there's Ganja, which is a major city in the west. It's an industrial center, so maybe it's involved in exporting goods. Another city could be Sumgayit, which is known for its chemical industry and might be involved in exports of chemicals and other products.

The Caspian Sea ports are important. So Baku's port is definitely one. Then there's the region of Absheron, which is near Baku and has oil fields, so that's a key area for exports of oil and gas. Also, the region of Shirvan might have some agricultural exports, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, maybe the main cities are Baku, Ganja, Sumgayit, and the port areas. Let me check again. Azerbaijan's main exports are oil, gas, and agricultural products. The ports on the Caspian Sea would be crucial. So Baku Port is a key player. Then the cities connected to the transport routes, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which goes through Baku. Also, the Heydar Aliyev International Airport in Baku handles a lot of cargo. 

Ganja is a big industrial city, so it's involved in manufacturing and exports. Sumgayit is another industrial center, especially chemicals. Then there's the region of Nakhchivan, but I think its trade might be more limited. Maybe the answer includes Baku, Ganja, Sumgayit, and the Caspian ports. Let me make sure there's no other major regions. Maybe the region of Khizi or others, but I think the main ones",1,,
New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about the education system there. Azerbaijan follows a structure similar to other countries in the region, with primary, middle, and secondary education.

Middle school in Azerbaijan typically covers grades 5 to 9, which is part of the general secondary education. The curriculum would include a variety of subjects. Let me think about the core subjects. Usually, there's mathematics, science (which might be split into physics, chemistry, biology), languages (Azerbaijani, Russian, English), literature, history, geography, physical education, music, art, maybe some social studies, and computer science. Also, there could be subjects like civic education or life skills.

Wait, but how many exactly? I should check if there's an official source or standard curriculum. Since I can't browse the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. In many countries, middle school might have around 12-15 subjects. For example, in some systems, they might have:

1. Azerbaijani Language and Literature
2. Russian Language
3. English Language
4. Mathematics
5. Physics
6. Chemistry
7. Biology
8. History
9. Geography
10. Civic Education
11. Physical Education
12. Music
13. Art
14. Computer Science
15. Social Studies

But maybe some subjects are combined. For instance, science subjects might be integrated or taught separately. Also, depending on the school, there might be elective subjects. However, the question is about the number of subjects taught in middle schools generally. I think the standard number is around 12 to 15. But I need to be precise.

Wait, I remember that in Azerbaijan's middle school curriculum, there are 12 core subjects. Let me verify that. If I recall correctly, the Ministry of Education outlines the curriculum. The main subjects include Azerbaijani, Russian, English, math, physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, civic education, physical education, and computer science. That's 12 subjects. Maybe music and art are considered part of the broader curriculum but might not be counted as separate subjects in the official list. Alternatively, they could be included. Hmm.

Alternatively, some sources mention that middle school in Azerbaijan has 12 subjects. So I think the answer is 12. But I need to",1,,

New-ha-08,What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Azerbaijan?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a food that children in Azerbaijan typically dislike but the elderly enjoy. First, I need to think about traditional Azerbaijani cuisine and which dishes might fit this description.

Azerbaijani food includes dishes like plov, dolma, kebabs, and various soups. Some dishes might be more robust or have stronger flavors that adults prefer. For example, dishes with a lot of garlic or certain spices might be more appealing to older people. Also, some foods might be considered more comforting or nostalgic for the elderly.

I remember that ""dolma"" is a dish where grape leaves or other vegetables are stuffed with rice and meat. It's a common dish, but maybe the texture or the spices could be too much for children. Another possibility is ""khash,"" which is a traditional soup made from boiled cow's feet and is quite rich. However, khash is more of a winter dish and might not be as commonly associated with the elderly.

Wait, there's also ""tavuk göğsü,"" which is a milk-based dessert made from chicken breast. It's a bit unusual, but I'm not sure if children dislike it. Another thought: ""shish kebab"" is popular, but it's more of a meat dish that might be enjoyed by all ages.

Another angle: some fermented or preserved foods. For example, ""torshi"" (pickled vegetables) might be more enjoyed by older generations. However, children might not like the sour taste. Alternatively, ""qutab"" is a type of pancake, but I don't think that's disliked by children.

Wait, there's a dish called ""mujdu"" which is a type of porridge made from cracked wheat. It's a traditional breakfast food. Maybe the texture is something children don't prefer, but the elderly do. Or perhaps ""shirin halva,"" a sweet made from sesame paste. But that seems more like a sweet that children might like.

Alternatively, ""sığır başı"" (cow's head) is a traditional dish, but that's more of a regional or specific dish and might not be common. Also, it's more of a hearty meat dish that the elderly might prefer over children.

Wait, another thought: ""pilaf"" (rice dish) with specific spices. Maybe the elderly enjoy the traditional version with more herbs and spices, while children might find it too strong. But I'm not sure",1,,

Okay, so I need to figure out where high school students in Azerbaijan usually go after dinner. Let me start by thinking about common activities that students might do after eating. In many countries, students might go to places like parks, cafes, or maybe study at home. But I should consider the specific context of Azerbaijan.

First, I know that Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of cultural influences from both the East and West. High school students there might have similar routines to other countries, but there could be local variations. Let me think about the typical daily schedule. After dinner, which is usually around 7-8 PM, students might have some free time.

In some countries, students might hang out with friends, use social media, or do homework. But since the question is about where they go, not what they do, I need to think about physical locations. Common places could be parks, public areas, or maybe family time at home. However, I should check if there are any specific places unique to Azerbaijan that students frequent.

Another angle: in some cultures, after dinner, families might gather, but students might have friends over. However, in more conservative societies, students might be expected to be at home. Alternatively, there might be youth centers or community spaces. But I'm not sure about the presence of such facilities in Azerbaijan.

Also, considering the time of year. In the evenings, especially during warmer months, students might go to parks or outdoor areas. In winter, maybe they stay indoors. But the answer should be general, not seasonal.

I should also consider if there are any common practices or traditions. For example, in some countries, students might go to a local café or a place to socialize. However, I don't have specific information on Azerbaijan's high school students' post-dinner habits. Maybe they go to a nearby park, or perhaps they study at home. Alternatively, they might meet friends at a public place like a plaza or a café.

Wait, but I need to make sure the answer is accurate. If I'm not certain, maybe the most neutral answer is that they go home, as that's a common activity. However, some might go out with friends. But the question is about where they ""usually"" go, implying a common trend. If there's no specific data, the safest answer might be that they go home, but I should verify if there's any known information.

Alternatively, if there are specific places like a local café",1,,
