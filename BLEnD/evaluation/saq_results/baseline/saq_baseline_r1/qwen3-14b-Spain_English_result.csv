Jod-ch-07,"How long (in hours) on average does it take for people in Spain to have dinner at a restaurant? (Provide Arabic numerals up to one decimal point (e.g., 2, 3.5) only.)","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the average time people in Spain spend having dinner at a restaurant, in hours, with one decimal place.

First, I need to recall or find data on dining durations in Spain. I know that in many European countries, dinner is typically a more leisurely meal compared to some other regions. For example, in Spain, there's a cultural emphasis on taking time for meals, especially dinner, which might be later in the evening. 

But how long do they actually stay at the restaurant? Let me think. In some places, a dinner might last around 1.5 to 2 hours. But I need to be specific. Maybe I should check if there are any studies or surveys about this. However, since I can't browse the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

I remember that in Spain, dinner is often around 8 PM or later, and people might spend about 1.5 to 2 hours eating, including time for drinks and conversation. But the question is about the average time spent at the restaurant. If they arrive at 8 PM and leave by 10 PM, that's 2 hours. However, sometimes it might be shorter if they're in a hurry, but on average, considering the culture, maybe around 1.5 to 2 hours. 

Wait, maybe I should consider that in some cases, people might have a lighter dinner or leave earlier, but the average would still be on the higher side compared to, say, the US. I think 1.5 hours is a common estimate for a meal in Spain, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2 hours. 

I need to make sure I'm not conflating meal duration with time from arrival to departure. If the question is about the actual time spent eating, maybe it's less, but if it includes the entire time at the restaurant (including waiting, drinking, etc.), it could be more. 

But the question says ""have dinner at a restaurant,"" which likely refers to the total time from sitting down to leaving. So, considering that, I think the average is around 1.5 to 2 hours. However, I need to pick a specific number. Maybe 1.5 hours is a safe average, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, some sources might say 2 hours. 

Hmm, I think I've heard that in Spain, a typical dinner out",1,,

Jod-ch-60,What is the duration (in hours) of a typical workday in Spain? (Provide Arabic numerals (0~24) only.),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the duration of a typical workday in Spain. Let me start by recalling what I know about work hours in different countries. I remember that in many European countries, the standard workweek is around 35 to 40 hours. But Spain might have its own specifics.

First, I should consider the legal regulations. Spain has labor laws that set the maximum number of working hours. From what I've heard, the standard full-time workweek in Spain is 35 to 37.5 hours. But the question is about a typical workday, not the workweek. So I need to divide the weekly hours by the number of workdays.

Assuming a five-day workweek, if the total is 35 hours, then each day would be 7 hours (35 divided by 5). If it's 37.5 hours, that would be 7.5 hours per day. However, I should check if there are any variations. For example, some companies might have different schedules, but the typical or standard is likely based on the legal maximum.

Wait, but maybe Spain has a different structure. I think in some cases, the workday might be split into two shifts, but the total hours per day would still be around 8 hours. However, the legal maximum is 8 hours per day, but with possible exceptions. However, the standard full-time might be less. Let me verify this.

Looking up in my mind, I recall that Spain's labor law sets the maximum working hours at 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week. But many companies might have a 35-hour week, which would be 7 hours a day. However, there's also the possibility of flexible hours. But the typical workday duration... Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the standard is 8 hours a day, but with a shorter week. Wait, but 8 hours a day times 5 days is 40 hours. But Spain might have a shorter week. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

I think the standard in Spain is a 35-hour workweek, which would be 7 hours per day. But I'm not 100% sure. Some sources I remember mention that Spain has a 35-hour week as the standard for full-time employment. So 35 divided by 5 days is 7 hours per day. Therefore, the answer would",1,,

Ne-ar-09,What do people from Spain eat in Eid ul Fitr?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what people from Spain eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what Eid ul Fitr is. It's a Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. So, during this time, Muslims around the world celebrate with feasts and specific foods.

Now, the question is about Spain. Spain is a country in Europe with a predominantly Christian population, but there's a significant Muslim community there as well. However, Spain's traditional cuisine is influenced by its history, including Moorish, Roman, and other cultures. But does that mean that during Eid ul Fitr, Spanish Muslims would eat traditional Spanish dishes, or do they have their own specific foods for the occasion?

Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Eid ul Fitr is a religious holiday, so the foods eaten would be part of the broader Islamic tradition, not necessarily specific to Spain. However, the user is asking about people from Spain, so they might be referring to the local dishes that are consumed by Muslims in Spain during this time.

But I should check if there are any unique dishes associated with Eid ul Fitr in Spain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that they eat similar foods to other Muslim communities, like sweets, pastries, and traditional dishes, but adapted to local ingredients or Spanish cuisine.

Wait, but the user might be under the impression that there's a specific Spanish dish for Eid, but I don't recall any. In many countries, Eid foods are often traditional sweets like baklava, but in Spain, maybe they have their own version. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that there isn't a specific Spanish dish for Eid ul Fitr, as the celebration is more about breaking the fast with traditional Islamic foods that are common in the region, which might be similar to other Muslim-majority countries but adapted to local tastes.

But I need to be careful here. The user might be expecting that since Spain is a specific country, there's a particular answer. However, I don't think Spain has a unique dish for Eid ul Fitr. The main foods would be similar to those eaten by Muslims in other countries during Eid, such as dates, sweets, and traditional dishes, but prepared with local ingredients.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that people in Spain, being non-Muslim majority, might not have specific traditional dishes for Eid ul Fitr, but Muslim communities there would prepare typical Eid foods like",1,,

Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in Spain's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the required subjects for Spain's university entrance exam. I remember that Spain has something called the PAU, which is the Prueba de Acceso a la Universidad. From what I've heard, the PAU is the exam students take to get into university. Now, the subjects required might depend on the student's previous education. 

In Spain, there are two main educational tracks: the Bachillerato, which is the upper secondary education, and the LOGSE (Ley Orgánica de Educación) system. Wait, but the Bachillerato is part of the LOGSE. So, students who have completed the Bachillerato would take the PAU. However, there's also the possibility of students who didn't take the Bachillerato, like those who have done the old system or have other qualifications.

For the Bachillerato students, the PAU usually requires them to take the subjects they studied in their final year. For example, if they chose the Science and Technology branch (Ciencias y Tecnología), they would need to take subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and maybe a specific subject related to their branch. Similarly, if they are in the Humanities branch (Humanidades), they might have to take subjects like History, Philosophy, and a language.

But wait, there's also the general subjects that all students must take. I think all students have to take a common part, which includes Spanish Language and Literature, a foreign language (usually English), and a subject from their chosen branch. Then there's the specific part, which varies by branch. Also, some universities might require additional subject-specific exams depending on the program they're applying to.

Another thing to consider is that students who haven't completed the Bachillerato, like those with a FP (Formación Profesional) qualification, might have different requirements. They might need to take certain subjects plus the general part of the PAU. However, the question is about the required subjects in the entrance exam, so maybe it's focusing on the standard Bachillerato students.

Wait, but the answer needs to be a list of the required subjects. So, the general required subjects would be the common ones plus the specific ones based on the branch. However, the exact list might vary by region in Spain because each autonomous community can set their own requirements. But generally, the core subjects would include the common ones and the branch-specific ones.

So, putting this together, the required subjects for the PAU in",1,,

Th-en-53,What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the most popular extracurricular social event in Spanish schools. First, I need to recall what extracurricular activities are common in Spain. I know that in many countries, sports events are popular, like sports days or tournaments. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Spain specifically.

Wait, I remember that in Spain, there's a big emphasis on festivals and cultural events. Maybe something like ""Feria de Abril"" in Seville, but that's more of a city event. However, schools might have their own versions of festivals or cultural days. Alternatively, maybe it's related to traditional celebrations like ""La Tomatina,"" but that's a town event too.

Another angle: looking at common school activities. In many places, dances, talent shows, or sports competitions are popular. But in Spain, maybe the ""Fiesta de la Virgen"" or other religious festivals are significant. However, I'm not certain if these are school-based.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like ""Día de la Hispanidad"" which is a national holiday, but again, not sure if it's an extracurricular event at schools. I should consider more general events. Another thought: in some countries, school carnivals or fairs are common. Maybe in Spain, similar events are held, like ""feria escolar"" or ""fiesta escolar.""

Wait, I think I've heard that ""La Feria de Abril"" is a big event, but that's in Seville. However, schools might have their own smaller versions. Alternatively, maybe the ""Carnaval"" is a big event, but that's more regional. 

Alternatively, looking up common school activities in Spain. From what I know, sports events like inter-school competitions or sports days might be popular. Also, cultural events like theater performances or music festivals. But which one is the most popular?

I think I need to make an educated guess here. Since the question asks for the most popular, and considering that in many countries, sports days or cultural festivals are common, but in Spain, perhaps the ""Fiesta de la Virgen"" or similar religious festivals are significant. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the answer might be ""Feria de Abril,"" but that's more of a city event. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""Día de la Hispanidad"" or ""Día de la Constitución,"" but those",1,,

Ne-ar-38,Which food do people usually offer as charity in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking which food is usually offered as charity in Spain. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall any traditions or common practices in Spain related to food and charity. Maybe there's a specific item that's commonly donated. I know that in some countries, certain foods are more typical for charitable donations. For example, in the US, non-perishables like canned goods are common. But Spain might have something different.

Wait, I remember that in Spain, there's a tradition called ""la lotería de Navidad"" during Christmas, but that's more about lottery tickets. Not sure if that's related to charity food. Alternatively, maybe it's about food banks or local charities. 

Another angle: maybe specific foods that are culturally significant. For instance, bread is a staple in many Spanish meals. But is it commonly given as charity? Or perhaps something like paella? No, paella is more of a regional dish and might not be practical for large-scale donations.

Wait, there's a charity event called ""la carrera de la tarta"" (cake race) in some places, but that's more of a fundraiser. Not sure about the food aspect. 

I think I've heard that in Spain, people often donate non-perishable items like canned goods, pasta, or rice. But the question is about a specific food. Maybe there's a particular item. Alternatively, perhaps ""pan"" (bread) is commonly donated. In some countries, bread is a common charitable item because it's a basic need and has a long shelf life. 

Alternatively, maybe ""galletas"" (cookies) or ""leche"" (milk). But I need to be accurate. Let me try to verify. 

Wait, I think in Spain, ""la Cruz Roja"" (Red Cross) and other organizations collect non-perishable items. Common items would be things like pasta, rice, canned vegetables, beans, and maybe also baby food. But the question is asking for a specific food that people usually offer. 

Wait, maybe ""pan"" is the answer. Because in many cultures, bread is a staple and often given as charity. For example, in the UK, bread is sometimes given to the homeless. In Spain, maybe similar. But I'm not 100% sure. 

Alternatively, maybe ""conservas"" (canned goods) in general. But the answer needs to be specific.

New-gr-15,What is the most popular traditional dessert in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most popular traditional dessert in Spain. Let me think. I know Spain has a variety of desserts, like churros, flan, tarta de Santiago, and maybe others.

First, I need to determine which one is the most popular. Churros are definitely well-known, especially since they're often eaten with chocolate sauce. But I should check if there's a more traditional or widely consumed one. 

Flan is another classic, a custard dessert that's popular across many Spanish-speaking countries. Tarta de Santiago is a type of almond cake from Galicia, but is it the most popular nationally? 

I think churros might be more commonly associated with Spain in general, especially in tourist areas. However, flan is also very traditional and widely eaten. Maybe the answer depends on regional preferences. 

Wait, some sources might indicate that flan (crema catalana in Catalonia) is a staple. But churros are also a traditional dessert, often sold by street vendors. 

Hmm, perhaps the answer is churros. But I need to be sure. Let me recall if there are any surveys or common consensus. I remember that in Spain, both churros and flan are popular, but maybe churros are more iconic as a dessert. Alternatively, maybe the most popular is something else like tarta de Santiago. 

Wait, but tarta de Santiago is more specific to Galicia. The national dessert might be something more widespread. Another possibility is the ""rosquilla,"" which is a type of ring-shaped pastry, but I'm not sure about its popularity. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""churros con chocolate."" However, the user is asking for a dessert, not a snack. Churros are typically considered a dessert. 

I think the safest answer here is that churros are the most popular traditional dessert in Spain. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe it's flan. I need to decide based on common knowledge. Let me check my memory: in many Spanish homes, flan is a common dessert, and it's also found in other countries. Churros are more of a street food. So perhaps flan is more traditional and popular. 

Wait, but the question is about the most popular. Maybe it's a tie, but the answer should be one. I think I've heard that churros are often cited as a traditional Spanish",1,,

New-su-34,What is the most popular extracurricular activity related to music in schools in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the most popular extracurricular music activity in Spanish schools. Let me start by recalling what I know about music education in Spain. I know that Spain has a rich musical culture, with flamenco being a significant part of their heritage. But extracurricular activities might not just be about traditional music.

First, I should consider common school extracurriculars related to music. In many countries, choir, band, or orchestra are common. But in Spain, maybe there's something specific. I remember that in some schools, especially in regions like Andalusia, flamenco is taught. However, is that an extracurricular activity or part of the curriculum?

Another angle: school bands or orchestras. Maybe in Spain, they have school orchestras or ensembles. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular. Alternatively, music clubs or groups where students can play instruments or sing. Also, maybe music competitions or festivals are popular, but that's more of an event than an activity.

Wait, I should check if there are any official sources or studies. But since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. In many European countries, choir participation is high. Spain might have similar trends. However, considering the influence of flamenco, maybe there's a focus on traditional music. But I'm not certain if that's the most popular extracurricular.

Alternatively, perhaps instrumental music programs, like learning guitar, piano, or other instruments. But again, that might be part of the curriculum rather than an extracurricular. Extracurricular would be after-school activities. Maybe school choirs or music ensembles are the main ones. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe dance groups that incorporate music? But the question specifies music-related activities.

Another thought: in Spain, there's a strong emphasis on music education in schools, so maybe the most popular extracurricular is the school choir or a music club. But I need to be sure. If I can't find specific data, I might have to go with the most common answer, which could be school choir or music ensembles. However, I should also consider that in some regions, specific traditional music groups might be more common. But without specific data, it's safer to go with the general case.

So, based on general knowledge, the most popular extracurricular music activity in Spanish schools is likely the school choir or music ensemble. Alternatively",1,,

Ne-ar-36,What is a typical festive meal in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about a typical festive meal in Spain. Let me think. First, I need to recall Spanish holiday traditions. The main festivals in Spain include Christmas, Easter, and maybe others like San Fermín or La Tomatina, but those are more about events than meals. The most common festive meal would probably be during Christmas or Easter.

For Christmas, I remember that in Spain, they have a big dinner on Christmas Eve, called Nochebuena. The meal usually includes dishes like bacalao (salted cod), which is a traditional Christmas dish. Then there's also the Christmas cake, called roscón de Reyes, but that's more for the Epiphany, which is January 6th. Wait, the user said ""festive meal"" in general, not necessarily Christmas. Maybe they mean the main holiday meal.

Another possibility is the Easter meal, which might include dishes like cochinillo (roast suckling pig) or huevos de Pascua (Easter eggs, but those are more symbolic). But I think the most iconic festive meal is the Christmas Eve dinner. Also, during Christmas, they might have a lot of seafood, like mariscada, which is a seafood platter. However, bacalao is more specific to Christmas.

Wait, but the user wants a list in JSON format. They said ""provide one single answer as a list form"". So I need to list the main components of the meal. Let me confirm: the typical festive meal in Spain, especially during Christmas, includes bacalao, which is a key dish. Other possible items could be patatas bravas, ensaladilla rusa (Russian salad), and for dessert, the roscón de Reyes. However, the roscón is more for Epiphany, so maybe not part of the main Christmas meal. Alternatively, they might have turrón or other sweets.

But the user might be looking for the main course. So the primary answer would be bacalao. However, sometimes people mention other dishes. Let me check if there's a standard answer. In many sources, the traditional Christmas Eve meal in Spain features bacalao, so that's probably the main answer. So the answer should be a list with bacalao as the main item. But the user wants a list, so maybe multiple items. However, the user said ""one single answer as a list form"", so perhaps the main dish is bacalao. Alternatively,",1,,

Okay, the user is asking for the representative export item of Spain. Let me think. I know Spain is known for various products. They have a lot of agricultural products, like olive oil and wine. Also, maybe cars or machinery? Wait, but what's the most representative?

I remember that Spain is one of the top producers of olive oil in the world. They also export a lot of wine, especially from regions like Rioja and Priorat. But maybe the answer is more about a specific item. Let me check my knowledge. 

Wait, another thought: Spain is known for its automotive industry, with brands like Seat and Renault. But I'm not sure if that's the main export. Alternatively, maybe they export a lot of machinery and vehicles. However, the question asks for the representative export item, which might be more of a primary product rather than manufactured goods. 

Wait, I think the top exports of Spain include machinery, vehicles, and chemical products. But the most representative? Maybe olive oil? Or maybe wine? Or perhaps something else. Let me try to recall the top exports. 

According to recent data, Spain's main exports are machinery, vehicles, and chemicals. However, agricultural products like olive oil and wine are also significant. But the question is about the representative one. Maybe the answer is machinery and vehicles? Or is there a more specific item? 

Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a single item. If I have to choose one, maybe olive oil is the most iconic. But I'm not 100% sure. Wait, another angle: Spain is the world's largest producer of olive oil. That might make it the representative export. But I need to confirm that. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is vehicles and machinery. However, the user might be expecting a product like olive oil or wine. Let me think again. If I have to provide one answer, which is the most representative? Maybe olive oil is the answer here. But I should be careful. Let me check my knowledge again. 

Wait, I think the answer is machinery and vehicles. But the user might be looking for a specific product. Alternatively, maybe the answer is wine. But I need to be precise. Let me think of the top exports. 

According to the latest data, Spain's top exports include vehicles, machinery, and chemical products. However, agricultural products like olive oil and wine are also significant. But if the question is about the representative, perhaps the answer is olive oil",1,,

Okay, the user is asking about a common snack for preschool kids in Spain. Let me think.

First, I need to recall typical Spanish snacks. I know that in Spain, they have a lot of traditional foods. For kids, maybe something simple and healthy. Torrijas come to mind, but those are more of a dessert, maybe for breakfast. Then there's churros, but those are fried and might be more of a treat. Maybe something like ""turrón,"" but that's a nougat, usually eaten around Christmas. 

Wait, there's also ""panellets,"" but those are from the Balearic Islands and also seasonal. Maybe ""galletas"" (cookies) or ""bocadillos"" (sandwiches). But the question specifies preschool kids, so maybe something even simpler. 

I remember that in Spain, ""leche con cacao"" (milk with cocoa) is a common drink, but that's a drink, not a snack. What about ""frutas"" (fruits)? Maybe they have fruit snacks. Or ""merienda,"" which is the afternoon snack. Common merienda items could be something like ""turrón de almendra"" (almond nougat) or ""chocolate con leche"" (milk chocolate). 

Wait, but I need to be specific. Another thought: ""albóndigas"" (meatballs) are a main dish, not a snack. Maybe ""patatas bravas"" (fried potatoes with sauce), but that's more of an appetizer. 

Wait, I think ""turrón"" is actually a common snack, even for kids. It's a sweet made from almonds and honey, and it's popular in Spain. However, I should verify if it's commonly given to preschoolers. Alternatively, maybe ""galletas de chocolate"" (chocolate cookies) are more common. 

Another angle: looking at typical Spanish preschool snacks, they might have something like ""leche con galletas"" (milk with cookies) or ""sandwiches de jamón y queso"" (ham and cheese sandwiches). But I'm not sure if that's the most common. 

Wait, I think ""turrón"" is often given as a snack, especially during certain times of the year, but maybe not every day. Alternatively, ""churros con chocolate"" are a popular snack, but again, maybe more of a treat.

Ji-ko-28,When is the first day that people celebrate after a child is born in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the first day people celebrate after a child is born in Spain. Let me think.

I remember that in many cultures, there are specific traditions around a newborn's first days. For example, in some places, there's a celebration on the first day, or maybe the 8th day. Wait, Spain has a tradition called ""la primera comunión,"" but that's for first communion, not the birth. Maybe it's the ""lactancia"" period? No, that's about breastfeeding.

Wait, there's a tradition called ""el día de la madre"" or ""el día del padre,"" but those are for parents, not the child's first day. Another thought: in some Spanish-speaking countries, they have a ""bautizo"" (baptism), but that's usually a few weeks later. 

Oh! I think in Spain, the first celebration might be on the 8th day, known as ""la octava."" Wait, no, the octava is the 8th day after birth, but I'm not sure if that's a celebration. Let me check. Maybe it's the ""lunes de Pascua"" but that's Easter. 

Wait, another angle: in some regions of Spain, there's a tradition called ""el aguinaldo"" but that's more for Christmas. Hmm. Maybe the first celebration is on the first day, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the ""duodécima"" (12th day) or something else. 

Wait, I think the answer is that in Spain, the first celebration is on the 8th day after birth, known as ""la octava"" or ""el octavo día."" But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the first Sunday after birth. Wait, but I need to be accurate here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first celebration is the ""bautizo,"" but that's not necessarily on a specific day after birth. Let me think again. Maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific day, but the first celebration is the naming ceremony, which can be on the 8th day. Or perhaps the answer is that they celebrate the first day as ""el primer día"" but I don't think that's a specific holiday. 

Wait, I found in some sources that in Spain, the first celebration is on the 8th day, called ""la octava,"" which is a celebration",1,,
Na-ko-33,What symbolic food do people from Spain eat on (Lunar) New Year?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about symbolic food that people in Spain eat during Lunar New Year. Let me think. Wait, Spain is a country that celebrates the Lunar New Year, but I know that the main traditional New Year in Spain is December 31st, not the Lunar one. But maybe they do have some customs related to the Lunar New Year, especially since there's a significant Chinese community in Spain.

Hmm, the question mentions ""Lunar New Year,"" which is more associated with East Asian cultures. However, in Spain, the main New Year's Eve is on December 31st, where they eat 12 grapes, one for each strike of the clock at midnight. But that's not Lunar New Year. Wait, maybe the user is confused between the Gregorian New Year and Lunar New Year. However, the question specifically says ""Lunar New Year."" 

I should check if there's any traditional food in Spain associated with the Lunar New Year. Maybe the Chinese community there has their own customs. For example, in many countries with Chinese populations, they eat dumplings, fish, or other symbolic foods. But does Spain have a specific dish for that? Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the general New Year, but the question says Lunar New Year. 

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The main New Year in Spain is the Gregorian one, and the Lunar New Year is more of a Chinese tradition. So perhaps in Spain, during the Lunar New Year, the Chinese community would eat traditional foods like dumplings or fish, but the general Spanish population might not have a specific dish for that. However, the question is about people from Spain, not necessarily the Chinese in Spain. So maybe the answer is that they don't have a specific symbolic food for Lunar New Year, but if they do, perhaps they adopt some Chinese customs. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the 12 grapes but that's for the Gregorian New Year. So I need to confirm if there's any specific food in Spain for Lunar New Year. If there isn't, the answer might be that there's no traditional symbolic food, but since the user is asking for one, maybe they expect something else. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question, thinking that Spain has a Lunar New Year tradition. Alternatively, maybe in some regions or among certain communities, they do have specific foods. 

I think the safest answer is that there isn't a traditional symbolic food",1,,

Ne-ar-06,What do people from Spain eat in Ramadan?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking what people from Spain eat during Ramadan. First, I need to consider that Spain is a predominantly non-Muslim country, so not all Spaniards would observe Ramadan. However, there might be Muslim communities in Spain, such as the Moroccan or other Muslim minorities, who do fast during Ramadan.

I should think about traditional Spanish foods that are commonly eaten during iftar (the meal to break the fast) and suhoor (the pre-dawn meal). But wait, maybe the question is more about what the Muslim community in Spain eats, not the general population. So, I need to focus on the dietary habits of Muslims in Spain during Ramadan.

Common foods during Ramadan in many Muslim countries include dates, which are traditional for breaking the fast. Also, dishes like soups, stews, and various sweets might be part of their meals. However, since Spain has its own cuisine, there could be a blend of traditional Spanish dishes with Middle Eastern or North African influences, considering the Muslim communities there might have those culinary traditions.

But I need to be careful not to assume. Maybe the answer is that people from Spain, particularly those observing Ramadan, eat similar to other Muslim communities, but with local ingredients. However, the question might be expecting a more specific answer. Wait, but the user is asking about people from Spain, not necessarily the Muslim population there. However, since not all Spaniards are Muslim, the answer might be that they don't observe Ramadan, but if they do, they would follow the same practices as other Muslims, eating traditional foods like dates, soups, and other dishes common in Islamic cultures.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that people in Spain who observe Ramadan eat the same as in other Muslim countries, but with local adaptations. However, the user might be expecting a list of specific foods. But since the user wants a list in JSON format without examples, perhaps the answer is that they eat traditional Islamic foods, but I need to be precise.

Wait, the question is a bit tricky because Spain is not a predominantly Muslim country. So, the answer might be that people from Spain who observe Ramadan eat similar to other Muslim communities, such as dates, soups, and traditional dishes, but the answer should be specific. However, without knowing the exact dietary habits of Spanish Muslims during Ramadan, it's safer to state that they follow the same practices as other Muslims, which include eating dates, fruits, and various dishes during iftar and suhoor. But maybe",1,,
Gu-ch-38,"What is the duration of undergraduate education in Spain? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how long undergraduate education lasts in Spain. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Spanish education system. Spain has a structure similar to other European countries, but I should verify the specifics.

First, I remember that in many European countries, undergraduate degrees are typically around 3 to 4 years. For example, in the UK, a bachelor's degree is usually 3 years, while in the US it's 4. Spain might be somewhere in that range.

Wait, Spain has a system called the ""Grado,"" which is the undergraduate degree. I think the standard duration is 4 years. But I should check if there are any exceptions. Some programs might take longer, like 5 years for certain professional degrees such as medicine or law. However, the question is about the general undergraduate education, not specific professional programs.

Also, considering the Bologna Process, which Spain adopted, the standard bachelor's degree is 3 years (180 ECTS credits). But I'm a bit confused because I've heard that some Spanish degrees take 4 years. Maybe there's a difference between the old and new systems? Before the Bologna Process, degrees were longer, like 5 years, but after the reform, they were adjusted to 3 or 4 years depending on the field.

Wait, let me clarify. The Bologna Process introduced the Grado (Bachelor's) and Máster (Master's). The Grado is 3 years (180 ECTS), and then a Máster is 1 year (60 ECTS). However, some fields might require an additional year, making it 4 years. For example, engineering or architecture might take 4 years. But the standard undergraduate degree is 3 years. However, I've also read that some programs, like Law or Medicine, might take longer, but those are professional degrees that might have different structures.

But the question is about the duration of undergraduate education in Spain. If the standard Grado is 3 years, then that's the answer. However, I need to confirm this. Let me think of specific examples. For instance, a Bachelor of Arts (Grado en Filología) is 3 years. But maybe in some cases, like if a student takes a double degree or does an Erasmus semester, it might take longer. But the standard duration is 3 years.

Alternatively, I've heard that in some cases, the undergraduate program is 4 years. Maybe",1,,

Ne-ar-26,What is the most famous public corporation in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most famous public corporation in Spain. Let me think about this. First, I need to clarify what a public corporation is. In Spain, public corporations are usually state-owned enterprises or entities that are publicly traded. So, they could be either government-owned companies or those listed on the stock exchange.

Now, which companies are well-known in Spain? I know that Iberdrola is a major electricity company and one of the largest in Europe. They're involved in renewable energy, which makes them significant. Another big name is Repsol, which is a major oil and gas company. Then there's Banco Santander, one of the largest banks in Spain and Europe. Also, Inditex, the parent company of Zara, is a huge fashion retailer. 

But the question is about the ""most famous."" I need to determine which one is more recognized. Iberdrola is well-known for energy, Repsol for oil, Santander for banking, and Inditex for fashion. However, Inditex might be more internationally recognized because Zara is a globally famous brand. But I should check if they are considered public corporations. Inditex is a publicly traded company, so it's a public corporation. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a state-owned enterprise. For example, Enagas, which is a gas infrastructure company, but I'm not sure if it's as famous. Also, Red Eléctrica de España (REE) is a key player in the electricity sector. However, Iberdrola is larger and more internationally known. 

Wait, but the user might be referring to the most well-known in terms of brand recognition. Zara is a global brand, so Inditex could be the answer. However, I need to confirm if the question refers to the largest in terms of revenue or market capitalization. If it's about market cap, Santander or Iberdrola might be higher. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for the most famous in terms of public presence. Iberdrola has been active in renewable energy projects, which might make them more prominent in recent years. However, Repsol is also a major player in the energy sector. 

I think the answer could be Iberdrola, but I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe the most famous is the Banco Santander. However, Inditex's Zara is a household name globally. But the",1,,
Ji-ko-36,Which subject’s academy/private educational institute do middle or high students most frequently attend in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Spain attend most frequently. Let me start by recalling what I know about education in Spain.

Spain has a public education system, but many students also attend private or semi-private schools. However, the question is about academies or private institutes, not necessarily full-time private schools. These might be after-school tutoring centers or specialized institutes.

In many countries, subjects like math, science, and languages are common areas where students seek extra help. In Spain, the education system includes compulsory education up to 16, and then high school (Bachillerato) until 18. Students might need help with subjects that are challenging or important for exams.

I remember that in some countries, English language institutes are popular because of the global importance of English. However, in Spain, since English is taught in schools, maybe it's not the most frequent. Alternatively, subjects like mathematics or science could be more common because they are often considered harder.

Wait, but there's also the possibility of specialized academies for preparing for university entrance exams (like the PAU or Selectividad). These might focus on specific subjects that are tested, such as math, physics, chemistry, or literature.

Another angle: in Spain, there are many private tutoring centers called ""academias."" These often offer classes in subjects that are part of the standard curriculum. Which subjects are most commonly sought after? Maybe those that are critical for university admissions or have higher difficulty.

Looking up some information (from prior knowledge), in Spain, academies often focus on subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, and languages (especially English). However, the most frequent might be mathematics because it's a foundational subject and commonly challenging for students.

Alternatively, considering the number of students needing help, maybe English is more frequent because of its importance for international opportunities, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the most common is general academic support, but the question specifies a subject.

Wait, perhaps there's data on this. From what I recall, in Spain, the most common subject for private tutoring is mathematics. But I should verify. Alternatively, maybe it's language subjects, like English or Spanish as a second language, but that might not be as common.

Alternatively, considering the structure of the Spanish education system, students might need help with subjects that are part of their Bachillerato, such as math, sciences, or humanities. However, without specific data, it's",1,,
Th-en-51,Which subject is considered the most important for students in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question: Which subject is considered the most important for students in Spain? Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I should consider the education system in Spain. They have primary, secondary, and higher education. The subjects they focus on might vary, but maybe there's a common one that's emphasized more.

In many countries, subjects like mathematics, languages, or sciences are often highlighted. But Spain has its own curriculum. Let me think about the PISA results. Spain has performed reasonably in math and science, but maybe there's a cultural emphasis on certain subjects. Also, the Spanish education system includes subjects like Spanish language, literature, history, and maybe religion. Wait, but the question is about the most important.

Another angle: university entrance exams. In Spain, the Selectividad (EBAU) is crucial for getting into university. The subjects tested there might indicate what's considered important. Typically, subjects like Spanish, foreign languages, math, and sciences are part of the exams. However, maybe the humanities are also important.

Wait, but the question is about what's considered the most important. There might be a subject that's prioritized over others. In some countries, math is seen as fundamental, but in Spain, maybe language? Or perhaps the emphasis is on the national language, Spanish, but that's taught from an early age.

Alternatively, considering the structure of the curriculum, subjects like ""Lengua Castellana y Literatura"" (Spanish language and literature) are core in primary and secondary education. They might be considered the most important because they form the basis of communication and cultural identity. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe other subjects like math or science are seen as more critical for future careers.

I should check if there are any official sources or surveys. For example, the Ministry of Education in Spain might have data on subject priorities. However, without current data, I need to rely on general knowledge. In many European countries, languages, especially the national language, are emphasized, but in Spain, there's also a focus on foreign languages like English.

Wait, but the question is about the most important. It's possible that there isn't a single subject universally considered the most important, but if I have to choose one, maybe Spanish language and literature, as it's a core subject in the curriculum and essential for communication. However, some might argue for mathematics or sciences. But I think in the context of the Spanish education system",1,,

Ca-sp-41,Where do the dependent elderly usually live in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking where dependent elderly people usually live in Spain. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many countries, elderly care can involve different settings like homes, nursing homes, or assisted living facilities. Spain has its own system. I remember that in Spain, there's a public healthcare system, and for elderly care, they might have specific institutions.

I think there are residential centers for the elderly, maybe called ""centros residenciales para personas mayores."" Also, there might be nursing homes or homes for the elderly, which could be part of the public or private sector. Some might live with family, but the question specifies ""dependent"" elderly, which probably means they need more care than just living at home.

Wait, the user wants the answer in a list as a JSON format. They want one single answer as a list. So I need to list the places where dependent elderly usually reside. Let me check if there are specific terms in Spain for these facilities. Maybe ""centros de día"" for day centers, but those are for daytime activities. For residential care, ""residencias de ancianos"" or ""centros residenciales"" are terms I've heard. Also, there might be ""hogares de ancianos"" which are similar to nursing homes.

So compiling this, the answer would include residential centers, nursing homes, and possibly assisted living facilities. I should make sure that the answer is accurate and uses the correct terminology for Spain. Also, considering the public system, some of these might be publicly funded. But the question is about where they live, not who funds it. So the main answer points would be the types of facilities. Let me confirm if there's a primary place they are usually housed. Maybe the most common is the residential centers for the elderly. So the answer list would be [""residential centers for the elderly"", ""nursing homes"", ""assisted living facilities""]. I need to make sure these terms are correct in the Spanish context. Alternatively, ""centros residenciales para personas mayores"" is the direct translation. But the user might expect the English terms. Wait, the user wants the answer in the JSON list, but the question is in English. The answer should probably use the English terms, but maybe the Spanish terms are better? However, the user didn't specify, so using the common English terms would be safer. So residential centers, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. That should cover the main options.",1,,

Gu-ch-08,What is the most popular sports among children in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular sports among children in Spain. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall what I know about sports in Spain. Spain has a rich sporting culture, and football (soccer) is definitely a big part of their national identity. I remember seeing a lot of kids playing football in parks and streets there.

But wait, are there other sports that might be popular among children? Maybe basketball? I know Spain has a strong basketball team, and they've won the EuroBasket several times. It's possible that basketball is also popular, especially in cities where there are professional teams. However, football is more widespread, especially in smaller towns and villages.

Then there's handball. Spain has a good handball team too, and I think they have a lot of youth programs. But again, football might still be more popular. What about other sports like tennis or cycling? Spain has produced some top athletes in those areas, but I'm not sure if they're as popular among children as football.

I should also consider the influence of media and professional leagues. Football has a massive following, with La Liga being one of the top leagues in the world. Kids might be more exposed to football through TV, social media, and local clubs. Plus, the presence of famous players like Lionel Messi (though he's from Argentina, he played for Barcelona) and other Spanish stars like Iker Casillas or Sergio Ramos could make football more appealing to children.

Another angle: school sports programs. In many Spanish schools, football is a common activity. I've heard that in some regions, football is part of the physical education curriculum. Other sports might be offered, but football is likely the most common.

Are there any surveys or statistics that back this up? I think a 2021 report mentioned that football is the most popular sport in Spain, followed by basketball, cycling, and handball. But since the question is about children specifically, the trend might be similar. Also, the popularity of the national team, like the Spain national football team's success in the Euros and World Cup, could influence children's interest.

I should also check if there are any other sports that might be more popular in certain regions. For example, in the Basque Country, pelota (a traditional sport) is played, but that's probably less common nationally. So, overall, football seems to be the top choice, with basketball and handball as close contenders. However, the question asks",1,,

New-in-01,Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Spain. Let's start by recalling what I know about coffee culture there. Spain has a strong coffee tradition, but I'm not sure about the current popular chains.

First, I know that Starbucks is a global brand and is present in many countries, including Spain. They might have a significant presence there. But I also remember that in some European countries, local chains or other international brands might be more popular. For example, in Italy, places like Caffè Nero or local cafes are common, but Spain might be different.

Then there's the Spanish brand called ""Café de la Mocha,"" but I'm not sure if that's a chain or just a local café. Another possibility is ""Cafés Zalamea,"" which I think is a well-known Spanish coffee chain. They have a long history and are quite popular in Spain, especially for their traditional coffee culture.

Wait, but I should check if there are other international chains. For example, Costa Coffee is also present in Spain. However, I'm not certain if they are more popular than local brands. Also, there's ""The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf,"" but again, not sure about their popularity in Spain.

Looking up some references in my mind, I recall that in Spain, the most popular coffee chains might be a mix of local and international. However, Zalamea is often cited as a leading Spanish coffee brand. They have been around since the 1950s and are known for their quality and traditional methods. On the other hand, Starbucks has been expanding in Europe, including Spain, but maybe not as dominant as in other regions like the US or UK.

Another angle: sometimes the most popular might be the one with the most locations. If Zalamea has more outlets in Spain compared to Starbucks or Costa, then they might be the answer. Alternatively, if Starbucks has more stores, they could be the most popular. But I think Zalamea is more established in Spain's market.

Wait, but I should also consider that popular doesn't always mean the largest chain. Maybe a local chain is more popular in terms of customer preference. However, without specific data, it's tricky. But based on general knowledge, I think the answer is Zalamea. However, I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should confirm if there's a more recent trend. For example, has Starbucks become more",1,,

New-en-47,What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Spain. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many Mediterranean countries, including Spain, people have gardens with plants and maybe some fruit trees. But since it's the back garden, maybe there are specific elements common there. I've heard that Spanish homes often have outdoor spaces used for relaxation, like seating areas or patios. Maybe they have things like fountains or decorative elements.

Also, considering climate, Spain has a lot of sunny weather, so gardens might have drought-resistant plants. Maybe things like olive trees, citrus trees, or herbs. I've seen pictures of Spanish courtyards with tiles and maybe a small pool or water feature. But the question is about the back garden, not the courtyard. Wait, sometimes in Spain, the back garden might be more utilitarian, like a place for vegetables or herbs. Or maybe a place for outdoor dining.

Wait, but the user wants a single answer as a list. So I need to think of common elements. Let me check common elements in Spanish backyards. Maybe a garden with plants, maybe a patio area with tables and chairs, perhaps a barbecue or outdoor kitchen. Also, maybe a small pond or fountain. Or maybe a place for pets, like a dog run. But I'm not sure if that's typical. Another thought: in some regions, they might have a vegetable patch or a place to grow herbs. Also, maybe a pergola or shaded area with plants.

Wait, but the answer should be concise. The user probably wants the most common things. So perhaps the answer includes a garden with plants, maybe a patio, outdoor seating, and maybe a water feature. Alternatively, maybe a specific element like a ""jardín"" with flowers, but I need to be precise. I think the most typical would be a garden area with plants, possibly fruit trees, and maybe a patio or seating area. But I need to make sure it's accurate. Let me think of common elements. In Spain, back gardens might have a mix of ornamental plants, maybe some vegetables, and outdoor furniture. But I should avoid overcomplicating. The answer might be simply a garden with plants and perhaps a patio or seating area. Alternatively, maybe a ""jardín"" with specific elements like a fountain or a pool. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is more straightforward. Since the user says ""typically,"" the most common",1,,

Ji-ko-25,What are the family-related holidays in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about family-related holidays in Spain. Let me think. First, I need to recall the major public holidays in Spain and which ones are typically associated with family gatherings.

New Year's Day, January 1st, is definitely a big one. People often celebrate with family. Then there's Epiphany on January 6th, which is like Three Kings Day. Families gather for a big meal, especially with children, since the Three Kings bring gifts.

Semana Santa, Holy Week, is in March or April. It's a religious holiday with processions, but it's also a time when families might come together, though it's more solemn. Maybe not the most family-oriented, but still part of the culture.

May 1st is Labor Day, but that's more about workers, not family. Then there's Constitution Day on December 6th, which is a public holiday but not specifically family-related.

The main ones are definitely New Year's and Epiphany. Wait, what about Christmas? December 25th and 26th. Christmas is a major family holiday, with big dinners and gatherings. But the user might be looking for the official public holidays, so Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 26th) are public holidays in Spain. Also, the Feast of Saint Joseph on March 19th is a regional holiday in some areas, especially in Catalonia and Valencia, where families celebrate with meals and traditions like the ""Sop de Sardines"" in Catalonia. However, not all regions observe it as a public holiday.

Wait, the user wants family-related holidays. So including Christmas, New Year, Epiphany, and maybe the Feast of Saint Joseph where applicable. But I should check if Saint Joseph's Day is a national holiday or just regional. Since it's not a national holiday in all of Spain, maybe it's better to include it with a note, but the user wants only the answer in a list without examples. Hmm.

Also, there's the Day of the Virgin of the Pillar on October 12th, which is a public holiday in some regions like Aragon, but again, regional. The user might be looking for the most widely recognized ones. So the main ones would be New Year's Day, Epiphany, Christmas Day, and Christmas Day off (December 25th and 26th). Wait, in Spain, December 25th is Christmas Day, and December",1,,

Kik-in-36,Who is the most popular soccer coach in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking who the most popular soccer coach in Spain is. Let me think about this.

First, I need to consider current coaches in Spain. Spain has several top coaches, both in La Liga and the national team. The national team coach is Luis Enrique, but his popularity might be high. Then there's Pep Guardiola, who's a legendary coach, but he's currently coaching Manchester City, not in Spain. However, he's from Spain and might still be popular there. Then there's Xavi, who's the current manager of Barcelona. He's a former player and respected figure. Also, maybe someone like Julen Lopetegui, who's managed Real Madrid and the national team before. 

Wait, the question is about popularity, which can be subjective. It might depend on recent successes. For example, if Barcelona has been doing well under Xavi, he might be more popular now. Or if the national team has had a good run under Luis Enrique. Also, Guardiola's influence is huge even though he's not coaching in Spain currently. But since he's not actively coaching there now, maybe he's not the most popular currently. 

I should check recent rankings or polls. However, without current data, I need to rely on known information. As of recent years, Xavi has been a prominent figure as Barcelona's coach, and Luis Enrique has been with the national team. But I think Xavi's appointment as Barcelona's manager was well-received, making him a top candidate. However, I need to confirm if he's still the most popular. Alternatively, maybe someone like Mikel Arteta, but he's with Arsenal. 

Wait, the user might be referring to the national team coach. If the question is about Spain's national team, then the answer would be Luis Enrique. But if it's about club coaches, then maybe Xavi. The question doesn't specify, so I need to consider both. However, the most popular overall might be someone like Pep Guardiola due to his global fame, but he's not coaching in Spain now. 

Alternatively, if the user is looking for the most popular currently, then Xavi as Barcelona's coach might be the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with Xavi as the current most popular coach in Spain, considering his role at Barcelona and his status as a former player. However, I need to make sure that there's no more recent information. Since I can't access",1,,

New-su-57,What is the most common livestock raised in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most common livestock raised in Spain is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Spanish agriculture and livestock. Spain is a country with a significant agricultural sector, and livestock farming is a big part of that.

First, I remember that Spain is one of the leading countries in the European Union for certain types of livestock. For example, I think they have a lot of cattle, maybe for beef or dairy. But I also recall that sheep and goats are common in Spain, especially in regions with more arid or mountainous terrain. The Mediterranean climate might influence the types of animals raised there.

Wait, there's also the famous Iberian pig, which is used for ham like Jamón Ibérico. That's a specific breed, but does that mean pigs are a major livestock? Or is it just a specialty product?

I should check the numbers. According to some sources, Spain has a large number of sheep. Maybe the highest number in the EU? Or is it cattle? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the regions. In the north, like Galicia or Asturias, there might be more cattle for beef or dairy. In the south, like Andalusia, maybe more sheep and goats. But overall, which is the most common?

I think the answer might be cattle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe sheep are more numerous. Another angle: the meat production. Spain is a major producer of beef, but also of lamb and goat meat. However, in terms of total numbers, sheep might outnumber cattle. For example, the number of sheep in Spain could be in the hundreds of millions, while cattle might be lower. 

Wait, I've heard that Spain has the largest sheep population in the EU. If that's the case, then sheep would be the most common. However, I need to confirm if that's the case. Also, considering that pigs are raised for pork, which is a significant industry in Spain. But again, numbers might differ.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is cattle. Let me try to recall some statistics. According to FAO or Eurostat data, Spain's livestock numbers. For example, in 2021, Spain had around 5 million cattle, 50 million sheep, and 10 million pigs. If that's accurate, then sheep would be the most common. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers. 

Another point: the type of farming.",1,,

New-ch-38,Which cities or regions are known for their import and export activities in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which cities or regions in Spain are known for their import and export activities. Let me start by recalling what I know about Spain's economy and major ports or trade hubs.

First, Spain has several major ports that handle a lot of trade. I remember that the port of Barcelona is one of the busiest in Europe. It's a key point for both imports and exports, especially for goods like cars, machinery, and consumer products. Then there's the port of Valencia, which is important for container traffic and might handle agricultural products as well.

Another big port is Algeciras, located in the southern region of Andalusia. I think Algeciras is one of the largest ports in Europe in terms of container traffic. It's a crucial gateway for trade between Spain and Africa, so that's definitely a major player in imports and exports.

The Canary Islands come to mind too. They are a significant region for trade, especially with South America and Africa. Their strategic location makes them a hub for transshipment of goods. Also, the port of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands is important for this reason.

Then there's the region of Catalonia, which includes Barcelona. Catalonia is economically strong and has a lot of industrial activity, so that would contribute to trade. The Basque Country might also be a region to consider, as it has a strong industrial base with companies in sectors like automotive and machinery. Bilbao is a city in the Basque Country, but I'm not sure if it's as prominent in trade as the ports.

Madrid, as the capital, is a major economic center, but I think its role in import/export might be more about logistics and distribution rather than direct port activities. However, it's possible that the region of Madrid is involved in trade through its infrastructure and transportation networks.

The port of Cartagena in the Murcia region is another one I should consider. It's a significant port for container traffic and might handle a variety of goods. Also, the region of Andalusia, besides Algeciras, has other ports like Cádiz, which might be involved in trade as well.

Wait, but the question is about cities or regions known for import and export activities. So I need to list cities and regions. So the main ones would be:

- Barcelona (as a city in Catalonia)
- Valencia (as a city)
- Algeciras (as a city in Andalusia)
- Canary Islands (as a region)",1,,
New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Spain? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Spain. Let me start by recalling the structure of the Spanish education system. Middle school in Spain is typically referred to as ""Educación Secundaria Obligatoria"" (ESO), which is for students aged 12 to 16. This is divided into four years, or courses, from 1st to 4th ESO.

Now, the subjects taught can vary depending on the school and the region, as Spain has some autonomy in education. However, there's a national curriculum that sets the core subjects. The main subjects in ESO include:

1. Spanish Language and Literature
2. Foreign Languages (usually English, sometimes French or German)
3. Mathematics
4. Natural Sciences (like Biology and Geology)
5. Social Sciences (History, Geography, etc.)
6. Physical Education
7. Visual Arts or Music
8. Technology or Technical Drawing
9. Religion or Ethics (depending on the school)
10. Orientation and Guidance

Additionally, there might be other subjects like Philosophy, Latin, or specific electives, but these might not be mandatory for all students. However, the core curriculum requires a certain number of subjects. 

Wait, but I need to count the mandatory subjects. Let me check again. The official curriculum for ESO has a list of subjects that are required. From the Ministry of Education's guidelines, the compulsory subjects include:

- Spanish Language and Literature
- Foreign Language (English)
- Mathematics
- Natural Sciences
- Social Sciences
- Physical Education
- Visual Arts or Music
- Technology
- Orientation and Guidance

That's 9 subjects. However, some sources might include Religion as a compulsory subject, but in some regions, it's replaced by Ethics. Also, there's the possibility of additional subjects like Philosophy in 4th ESO. But if we strictly count the mandatory ones, it might be around 9. However, I think there's a standard number that's commonly cited. Wait, maybe I'm missing some. For example, in some regions, they might have more specific subjects. But the national curriculum specifies the core subjects. Let me check a reliable source. According to the Spanish Ministry of Education, the ESO curriculum includes the following subjects:

1. Spanish Language and Literature
2. Foreign Language
3. Mathematics
4. Natural Sciences
5. Social Sciences
6. Physical Education
7. Visual Arts or Music",1,,

New-en-69,Which writers are commonly studied in literature class in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking which writers are commonly studied in literature classes in Spain. Let me think about this.

First, I know Spain has a rich literary tradition, so there are several key authors. The first ones that come to mind are the classical ones. Miguel de Cervantes is a must. He's the author of ""Don Quixote,"" which is a cornerstone of Spanish literature. Then there's Lope de Vega, a prominent figure of the Spanish Golden Age, known for his plays. Francisco de Quevedo is another Golden Age writer, famous for his poetry and prose.

Moving into the 19th century, José Zorrilla comes to mind for his epic poem ""Cantares de la Alhambra."" Also, Gaspar Núñez de Arce might be included, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should focus on the more universally recognized names.

In the 20th century, Gabriel García Márquez is a big name, though he's Colombian. However, his works like ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" are often taught in Spanish classes because they're part of the Latin American Boom and written in Spanish. Then there's Miguel Delibes, a Spanish novelist known for works like ""La familia de Pascual Duarte."" Camilo José Cela is another important figure, especially with his novel ""La familia de Pascual Duarte,"" which is a key text in Spanish literature.

Also, Federico García Lorca is essential for his poetry and plays, even though he was a poet. His works are studied extensively. Then there's Antonio Muñoz Molina, a contemporary writer. But maybe the user is more interested in the classical and modern canonical authors rather than contemporary ones.

Wait, the user might be looking for a list that's commonly taught in schools. So it's likely to include the Golden Age authors, 19th-century realists, and 20th-century modernists. Let me check if I'm missing any key names. Maybe Emilia Pardo Bazán for her contributions to realism. Also, the Generation of '98 writers like Miguel de Unamuno and Pío Baroja. But I'm not sure if they're as commonly studied in standard curricula.

I should verify if the list I have is accurate. Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Zorrilla, García Márquez, Delibes, Cela, Lorca,",1,,
Ni-en-12,What is the top university in Spain? (Provide the official name.),"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking for the top university in Spain and wants the official name. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall which universities in Spain are considered the top. I remember that Spain has several prestigious universities, but the top one is often mentioned as the University of Barcelona. Wait, but I should verify that. There's also the Autonomous University of Barcelona, but I think the University of Barcelona (Universitat de Barcelona) is the one that's ranked highest.

However, rankings can vary depending on the source. For example, QS World University Rankings, Times Higher Education, or other academic rankings might have different results. But generally, the University of Barcelona is consistently ranked as the top university in Spain. Let me check some recent data. In the latest QS rankings, the University of Barcelona was indeed ranked as the top in Spain. The official name in Spanish is ""Universitat de Barcelona,"" but the user might want the official name in English. Wait, the question says ""Provide the official name,"" so I should check if the official name is in Spanish or if it's translated. The official name is ""Universitat de Barcelona"" in Catalan, but since the question is in English, maybe they want the English translation. However, sometimes the official name is the Spanish version, like ""Universidad de Barcelona."" Wait, but the official name is actually ""Universitat de Barcelona"" in Catalan, but in Spanish, it's ""Universidad de Barcelona."" But which one is the official name? The university's official name is ""Universitat de Barcelona,"" but in Spanish, it's ""Universidad de Barcelona."" However, the university is located in Catalonia, where Catalan is the official language, so the official name might be in Catalan. But the user might expect the Spanish version. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me confirm.

Looking up the university's official website, the name is ""Universitat de Barcelona"" in Catalan, but the English version is ""University of Barcelona."" However, the official name might be in Catalan. But in academic contexts, when asked for the official name, it's possible that the Spanish version is acceptable, especially if the user is not familiar with Catalan. Alternatively, maybe the university has an official English name. Wait, the university's official website uses ""Universitat de Barcelona"" as the primary name, but in English, it's referred to as the University of Barcelona. However, the user is asking for the official name. So I",1,,
New-ha-08,What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking for a food that children in Spain typically dislike but the elderly enjoy. Hmm, I need to think about traditional Spanish foods and which ones might be more popular among older people versus kids.

First, I know that children often prefer sweeter or more familiar foods. Maybe something that's more savory or has a strong flavor? Let's think about common Spanish dishes. Tapas come to mind, but that's a broad category. Maybe specific items like chorizo or other cured meats? Wait, chorizo is quite spicy and strong, which kids might not like. But would the elderly prefer that?

Another thought: maybe something like huitlacoche? No, that's a Mexican ingredient. Or perhaps something with a lot of salt or umami. Maybe anchovies? They are used in Spanish cuisine, like in some tapas. Anchovies are salty and strong, which might not appeal to children but could be a delicacy for older people.

Wait, there's also a dish called ""patatas bravas,"" which are potato slices with a spicy sauce. The sauce can be quite hot, so maybe kids don't like the spiciness. But would the elderly enjoy that? Maybe not sure. Another possibility is ""jamón ibérico,"" which is a type of ham. It's a delicacy, but again, maybe not specifically disliked by children. 

What about ""espinacas con garbanzos"" (spinach and chickpeas)? That's a traditional dish, maybe more common in certain regions. It's a bit bland or earthy, which kids might not like. But I'm not sure if it's specifically associated with the elderly.

Wait, I remember hearing that in some cultures, certain foods like liver or offal are more popular among older generations. In Spain, ""hígado"" (liver) is a traditional food. Maybe ""hígado con chorizo"" or similar dishes. Children might not like the texture or taste of liver, while the elderly might prefer it. 

Alternatively, maybe ""boquerones"" (anchovies) are a possibility. They are often eaten as a tapa, and they are quite salty and strong. Kids might not like them, but older people might enjoy them as a delicacy. 

Another angle: the elderly might prefer more traditional or less processed foods. Maybe something like ""gazpacho,"" but that's a cold soup, and I don't think kids dislike it",1,,

Ni-en-31,What do people in Spain traditionally eat on Christmas Day?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about traditional Christmas Day food in Spain. Let me think. I remember that in many Spanish-speaking countries, they have a big dinner on Christmas Eve, which is Nochebuena. But the question specifically says Christmas Day, which is December 25th.

Wait, maybe I should confirm if the main meal is on the 24th or the 25th. In Spain, the main traditional meal is usually on Christmas Eve, which is the 24th. On Christmas Day itself, the meal might be more modest. But I need to be sure. 

So, for Nochebuena, the typical dishes include a seafood paella, which is a classic Spanish dish. Also, there's a roasted leg of lamb or a turkey, and a lot of seafood like oysters, shrimp, and mussels. Then there are the desserts like turrón, which is a nougat, and other sweets like polvorones. 

But on Christmas Day, maybe they have a different meal. Wait, I think on the 25th, the meal is simpler. They might have a traditional Spanish omelet (tortilla de patatas), which is a common dish. Also, maybe some meat dishes like cochinillo asado, which is a roasted suckling pig. But I'm not entirely certain. 

Alternatively, some sources say that on Christmas Day, people might eat a similar meal to Nochebuena but maybe with less emphasis on the seafood. Or perhaps the main course is a different type of meat. However, I should check if the answer is more about the 24th or the 25th. The question says Christmas Day, so December 25th. 

Wait, but I might be mixing up the traditions. Let me recall. In Spain, the big meal is on the 24th, and on the 25th, they might have a lighter meal, possibly with leftovers or a more family-style dinner. However, some regions might have their own traditions. For example, in some areas, they might eat a similar meal on the 25th. 

But the user is asking specifically for Christmas Day, so the 25th. However, I'm not 100% sure about the exact dishes. Maybe the answer includes both the 24th and 25th, but the question is about the 25th. Alternatively, maybe the",1,,
Al-en-36,What food is associated with Halloween in Spain?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the food associated with Halloween in Spain. Let me think.

First, I know that Halloween is more of an American tradition, but Spain might have its own take on it. However, Spain's main holiday around that time is La Noche de Brujas, which is similar to Halloween but not as commercialized. Wait, but maybe they have some specific foods?

I remember that in some Spanish-speaking countries, they might have traditional foods for Halloween, but I'm not sure about Spain specifically. Let me check. Oh, right, in Spain, the Day of the Dead is called Día de los Muertos, but that's on November 1st and 2nd. Wait, but Halloween is October 31st. Maybe they have some overlap?

Wait, maybe they don't have a specific Halloween food. But the user is asking for it. Maybe they have similar treats. In the US, it's candy, but in Spain, they might have something else. Alternatively, maybe they use traditional foods for the Day of the Dead, but that's different.

Alternatively, maybe they have ""churros"" or other treats, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think in some regions of Spain, especially in the Basque Country, they might have a tradition called ""La Noche de los Difuntos,"" but again, that's more related to the Day of the Dead. 

Wait, but the user is asking specifically about Halloween. Maybe in Spain, they don't have a specific food for Halloween, but they might have similar snacks. Or perhaps they use the same kind of candy as in the US. However, I think in Spain, the main thing associated with Halloween is the ""chocolate de los muertos,"" but that's for the Day of the Dead. 

Alternatively, maybe they have ""calaveras de azúcar"" (sugar skulls), which are associated with Día de los Muertos, not Halloween. So maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific food associated with Halloween in Spain, but since the question is asking for one, perhaps the closest would be the same as the Day of the Dead, but I need to confirm.

Wait, but the user wants a single answer. Maybe they have ""pan de muerto,"" but again that's for Día de los Muertos. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they have ""turrón"" or other sweets, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the answer",1,,
