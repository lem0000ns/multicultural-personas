Ji-ko-29,Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Algeria's society?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Algeria's society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algerian culture and traditions.

First, I know that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some Middle Eastern countries, the 13th birthday is a big deal because it's the age when a girl starts her menstrual cycle, but I'm not sure if that's the case in Algeria. Alternatively, maybe there's a tradition related to coming of age. In many places, turning 18 is a significant age because it's when you become an adult, so maybe that's it. But I should check if there's something specific to Algeria.

I also remember that in some Arab cultures, the 40th birthday is a major milestone, sometimes called the ""silver"" or ""fortieth"" birthday, which is celebrated with big gatherings. However, I'm not certain if that's the case in Algeria. Another possibility is that the 50th birthday might be significant, but again, not sure.

Wait, Algeria has a rich cultural heritage influenced by Arab, Berber, and French traditions. Maybe there's a local tradition. Let me think about any specific celebrations. For example, in some Arab countries, the 13th birthday for girls is marked with a special celebration, but I'm not sure about Algeria. Alternatively, maybe the 18th birthday is more important because it's the age of majority, allowing someone to vote, drive, etc. However, in some cultures, the 21st birthday is a big deal, like in the US, but that's more Western.

Another angle: religious influences. Since Algeria is a predominantly Muslim country, Islamic traditions might play a role. However, Islamic traditions don't specifically highlight certain ages for birthdays, unlike some other cultures. So maybe secular traditions are more relevant here.

I should check if there's any specific age that's commonly celebrated with more pomp and ceremony. Maybe the 18th birthday is the most common, as that's when someone becomes an adult. But I need to be careful not to assume without evidence. Alternatively, perhaps the 40th birthday is considered a major milestone, similar to the ""40th birthday"" in some other cultures.

Wait, I think in some parts of the Arab world, the 40th birthday is a significant event, often celebrated with large parties and family gatherings. If that",1,,,,,

Jod-ch-07,"How long (in hours) on average does it take for people in Algeria to have dinner at a restaurant? (Provide Arabic numerals up to one decimal point (e.g., 2, 3.5) only.)","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the average time Algerians spend having dinner at a restaurant, in hours, with one decimal place. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall if there's any existing data on dining durations in Algeria. I don't have specific statistics on this. Maybe I can infer based on general cultural practices. In many countries, dinner at a restaurant can vary from a quick meal to a longer dining experience. For example, in some cultures, dinner might be a more leisurely affair, while in others, people might eat quickly due to work schedules or other factors.

Algeria's culture might influence this. From what I know, Algerian cuisine often involves dishes that take time to prepare, and meals can be social events. However, this is more about home cooking. In restaurants, especially in urban areas, the time might depend on the type of restaurant. Fast food places would be quicker, while sit-down restaurants might take longer.

But the question is about the average. Without specific data, it's challenging to give an exact number. However, I can make an educated guess. In many countries, the average time for a restaurant dinner is around 1.5 to 2 hours. Considering that, maybe in Algeria it's similar. However, I should be cautious not to assume. If there's no data, perhaps the answer is that it's not available, but the user expects a numerical answer.

Wait, the user specified to provide Arabic numerals up to one decimal. So if I can't find exact data, maybe I should state that there's no available data. But the user might be expecting an approximate value. Alternatively, maybe there's a study or survey. Let me check my knowledge again. I don't recall any specific studies on this. 

In the absence of data, the safest answer is to state that there's no available data. However, the user might be expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the average time is similar to other countries. For example, in the US, it's about 1.5 hours on average. Maybe in Algeria, it's similar. But I can't be sure. 

Since the user requires a numerical answer, and given that I can't find specific data, perhaps the best approach is to provide an approximate value with a note that it's an estimate. However, the user's instructions say to provide the answer in the JSON format with the answer as a list. Since I can't confirm the",1,,,,1,1.0
New-spme-37,Which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Algeria. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about Algerian students studying overseas. Algeria has a number of students who go abroad for higher education. The main reasons might be the quality of education, availability of certain programs, or job prospects.

I remember that engineering is a popular field in many countries. But wait, maybe medicine? In some countries, medical schools are highly regarded. However, I think in Algeria, there might be a shortage of certain professionals. Let me think about the common professions that are in demand there.

Another angle: the countries where Algerian students commonly study. For example, France is a popular destination because of historical ties. In France, engineering and business degrees are common. Also, maybe in the US or UK, fields like engineering, computer science, or business administration.

Wait, but what's the most common? I think engineering is a big one. But I also recall that some sources mention that medicine is a popular choice. However, maybe the most common is actually engineering. Or perhaps business administration? Or even something like petroleum engineering due to Algeria's oil industry?

Wait, but I need to be accurate. Let me think of any statistics or reports I might have come across. From what I remember, in recent years, engineering degrees, especially in fields like civil, mechanical, or electrical engineering, are among the top choices. However, another possibility is that business administration is popular because of the need for management skills in various sectors.

Alternatively, maybe the most common is medicine. But I think that's more for students from countries with limited medical education opportunities. For Algeria, perhaps engineering is more common because of the infrastructure needs.

Wait, I should verify. Let me think about the number of Algerian students in France. In France, engineering schools (Grandes Écoles) are very prestigious. So maybe engineering is a top choice. Also, in the US, engineering programs are popular. So combining these, engineering might be the most common profession studied abroad by Algerian students.

Another thought: maybe law? But I don't think that's as common as engineering. Or maybe computer science? With the tech boom, but I'm not sure if that's the case for Algeria specifically.

Hmm. I think the safest answer here is engineering. But I need to be sure. Let me check my knowledge again. Yes, in various reports, engineering is often cited as one of the",1,,,,1,1.0
New-pe-49,Where do families gather to pray together in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking where families in Algeria gather to pray together. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Algeria is a predominantly Muslim country. So, the primary place for prayer would be related to Islam. In many Muslim countries, mosques are the main places for communal prayers. However, the question specifies families gathering, so maybe it's not just any mosque but a specific type or a common practice.

Wait, in some cultures, families might pray at home, especially for daily prayers. But for Friday prayers or special occasions, they might go to the mosque. However, the question is about where they gather together, which could be either at home or in a mosque. But I need to verify which is more common in Algeria.

Looking up some information, in Algeria, as in many Muslim countries, mosques are central for communal prayers. However, family prayers at home are also common, especially for daily prayers like Fajr, Dhuhr, etc. But the question might be referring to the main gathering place for prayers, which would be the mosque. However, the answer might include both home and mosque. Wait, the user wants a single answer in a list. Let me check if there's a specific term or place in Algeria for family gatherings for prayer.

Alternatively, maybe they refer to the home as the primary place for family prayers. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. In many Muslim households, families do pray together at home, especially for the five daily prayers. However, for Jumu'ah (Friday) prayers, they go to the mosque. But the question is about where they gather to pray together, which could be both. However, the answer might be the mosque, but I need to confirm.

Wait, maybe the answer is both the home and the mosque. But the user wants a single list. Let me check if there's a specific term. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the mosque. But I should be accurate. In Algeria, families may pray at home, but for communal prayers, the mosque is the place. However, the question is about families gathering, so maybe home is the answer. But I need to be precise. Let me check some sources.

After checking, in Algeria, it's common for families to pray at home, especially for daily prayers, and for Friday prayers, they go to the mosque. However, the question is about where families gather to pray together. Since the answer requires a single list, perhaps the answer includes both the home",1,,,,1,1.0

Ji-ko-24,What is the most preferred recreational facility among children in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most preferred recreational facility is among children in Algeria. Let me start by breaking this down. First, I should consider the cultural and geographical context of Algeria. Algeria is a country in North Africa, and like many countries there, traditional activities might be more common. However, with urbanization and globalization, there might be more modern recreational options too.

Children's preferences can vary based on age, but generally, they enjoy activities that are either physically active or provide entertainment. Common recreational facilities could include parks, playgrounds, sports fields, shopping malls with play areas, or maybe even places like arcades or video game centers. But I need to think about what's more prevalent in Algeria specifically.

I know that in many Middle Eastern and North African countries, public parks and playgrounds are common, especially in urban areas. These places often have swings, slides, and maybe some sports equipment. Also, considering the climate, outdoor facilities might be more popular during cooler months, but since Algeria can have hot summers, maybe indoor options are also considered. However, access to indoor recreational facilities might be limited compared to outdoor ones.

Another angle is the influence of Western culture. Maybe video game arcades or places with gaming consoles are popular among children. Alternatively, sports like football (soccer) are very popular in Algeria, so maybe sports fields or stadiums could be a point of interest. However, stadiums are more for organized sports rather than casual recreation.

I should also consider if there are any unique facilities specific to Algeria. For example, maybe traditional games or activities that are more culturally specific. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe community centers or schools have recreational areas that children use.

Looking up some references in my mind, I recall that in many developing countries, public playgrounds are the most accessible recreational facilities for children. They are often free or low-cost, which makes them more accessible to a larger population. Also, in areas where private recreational facilities are less common, public parks and playgrounds would be the primary option.

Another thought: Algeria has a significant youth population, so government or community initiatives might focus on building playgrounds and parks. Additionally, with increasing urbanization, cities might have more modern recreational facilities, but again, the most preferred might still be the traditional playgrounds.

I should also consider if there's any data or surveys about children's preferences in Algeria. However, without specific data, I have to rely on general trends. In many similar regions, playgrounds with",1,,,,0,0

New-su-24,What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in Algeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algeria's culture and popular sports.

First, Algeria is a country in North Africa. I know that football (soccer) is super popular there, similar to many other countries. It's the national sport, so maybe families play football together. But are there other sports that are common for families?

Then there's the traditional aspect. Maybe they have sports that are part of their heritage. I remember something about a game called ""Joule"" or ""Joule de la Fête"" which is a traditional sport during festivals. But I'm not sure if that's played by parents and kids together.

Another possibility is physical games that don't require much equipment. For example, playing catch with a ball, maybe with a makeshift ball. Or games like tag, which are common worldwide. But are these specifically common in Algeria?

Also, considering the climate, Algeria has a lot of open spaces and maybe beaches. So maybe beach volleyball or swimming? But I'm not certain if that's a common family activity.

I should also think about other sports that might be popular. Maybe basketball or handball? But I'm not sure about their prevalence in family settings.

Wait, I think I've heard that in some Arab countries, people play a game called ""Maktab"" which is a form of wrestling or martial arts. But again, not sure if that's for children and parents.

Alternatively, there's the game of ""Tchoukball,"" but I think that's more of an organized sport, not sure about family play.

Another angle: looking at the answer structure. The user wants a list in JSON, and the answer should be in a single list. So maybe the answer includes football (soccer), traditional games like Joule, and maybe others like tag or catch. But I need to confirm if these are indeed common in Algeria.

Wait, maybe I should check if ""Joule"" is actually played. Alternatively, ""Boules"" (like petanque) is popular in some regions. But is that a family sport?

Alternatively, ""Rugby"" might not be common there. Maybe ""Horseback riding"" in certain areas, but that's probably less common for families.

I think the safest answers are football and traditional games. Maybe also ""Kubb"" or other lawn games, but I'm not sure about their presence in Algeria",1,,,,1,1.0
Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in Algeria's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the required subjects for Algeria's university entrance exam. First, I need to recall what I know about Algeria's education system. The university entrance exam in Algeria is called the Baccalauréat, which is similar to other countries' secondary school leaving exams.

Now, the Baccalauréat in Algeria is divided into different tracks based on the student's stream. The main tracks are the scientific track (sciences), the literary track (letters), and the economic and commercial track (Economics and Management). Each track has its own set of required subjects.

For the scientific track, the core subjects would be Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Then there's a choice between Biology and Earth and Life Sciences, or maybe another subject like Computer Science. But I need to confirm if that's accurate.

The literary track would focus more on languages and humanities. So, subjects like Arabic, French, and English are probably required. Then, subjects like History, Geography, and Philosophy might be part of it. Also, there could be a choice between Mathematics and another subject like Economics or Civic Education.

The economic and commercial track is a mix of sciences and humanities. They might take subjects like Mathematics, Economics, and Business Management. Also, they might have to study French, Arabic, and maybe a foreign language. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact combination here.

Wait, I should check if there are any recent changes. The Baccalauréat in Algeria has undergone some reforms. For example, the number of exams might have been reduced, and some subjects combined. But the core subjects for each stream should still be similar. Also, there's a general stream, but I think the main ones are the three I mentioned.

Another point is that the exam includes both written and oral components. However, the question is about the required subjects, not the exam format. So I should focus on the subjects each track requires.

I need to make sure that the answer lists the subjects per track. However, the user's question is a bit ambiguous. Are they asking for all the possible required subjects across all tracks, or per track? The way the question is phrased, ""required subjects in Algeria's university entrance exam,"" without specifying a track, might imply that the answer should cover the main subjects required regardless of the track. But that's not possible since each track has different subjects.

Wait, maybe the user is looking for the main subjects that are common across all tracks",1,,,,1,1.0
New-pe-06,What is the most popular stew in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular stew in Algeria. Let me think. I know that different countries have their own traditional dishes. Algeria is a North African country, so maybe their cuisine is similar to other Maghreb countries like Morocco or Tunisia.

I remember that couscous is a staple in Algeria, but that's more of a dish with vegetables and meat, not a stew. Then there's tagine, which is a slow-cooked stew that's common in Morocco. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular in Algeria. Wait, maybe there's a specific Algerian stew.

Another thought: maybe ""chakhchoukha"" is a possibility. It's a dish made with bread soaked in a tomato-based sauce, but I'm not sure if it's considered a stew. Or perhaps ""brik"" but that's more of a fried pastry. 

Wait, I think there's a stew called ""tcherni"" or ""tcherni"" which is a type of lentil soup, but that's more of a soup than a stew. Alternatively, ""rougaille"" is a Provençal dish, but that's from France. 

Wait, maybe ""shakshuka"" is confused here, but that's more North African, not specifically Algerian. Let me check my memory again. Oh, I think the most popular stew in Algeria is actually ""bouillabaisse,"" but that's from France, so that can't be right. 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another angle: in Algeria, they have a dish called ""kouskous"" but again, that's not a stew. There's also ""harira,"" which is a soup, but again, not a stew. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is ""tagine,"" even though it's more associated with Morocco. But maybe in Algeria, they have their own version. Alternatively, maybe ""dolma"" but that's stuffed vegetables. 

Alternatively, ""chili con carne"" is not Algerian. Wait, I need to be accurate here. Maybe the answer is ""tcherni"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""soupe aux lentilles"" but that's lentil soup. 

Wait, I found conflicting information in my mind. Let me think again. The most common stews in North Africa include tagine, but in Algeria, a popular stew might be ""brik""",1,,,,0,0

New-en-41,Who is the most well known and successful entrepreneur in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most well-known and successful entrepreneur in Algeria is. Let me start by recalling any prominent business figures from Algeria.

First, I know that Algeria has a significant oil and gas industry, which is a major part of its economy. Maybe someone from that sector? There's Sonatrach, which is the state-owned oil company. However, since it's state-owned, the entrepreneurs there might not be as individually prominent as in private sectors.

Then there are other industries. Maybe telecommunications? I remember that Orange Algeria is a big player, and they might have had notable entrepreneurs. But I'm not sure about specific names.

Another angle: tech entrepreneurs. Algeria has a growing tech scene. Maybe someone like Karim Benzema? Wait, no, he's a footballer, not an entrepreneur. Maybe someone from the startup world? I'm not certain about names here.

Wait, there's a name that comes up in discussions about Algerian business: Samir Bensaad. He's the founder of BESA, a company involved in construction and real estate. BESA has been involved in major projects, so he might be a candidate.

Alternatively, I've heard of Ahmed Haddad, who is associated with the telecom sector. He was the CEO of Orange Algeria. But is he considered the most successful?

Another possibility is Mourad Ben Barek, but he's more of a businessman in the media sector, maybe? Or perhaps someone from the banking industry?

Wait, I should verify. Let me think. Samir Bensaad is often cited as one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Algeria, given his influence in construction and real estate. His company, BESA, has been involved in large-scale projects, including the construction of the Algiers subway. That might make him a top contender.

But I need to be careful. There might be others. For example, Rachid Amrouche, who is part of the Amrouche family involved in various sectors like construction and media. However, I'm not sure if he's more prominent than Bensaad.

Also, considering the political and economic context, some entrepreneurs might have ties to the government or have faced challenges due to Algeria's economic issues. But the question is about being well-known and successful, not necessarily politically connected.

Another angle: international recognition. Are there Algerian entrepreneurs who have gained global attention? Maybe not as much as from other countries, but perhaps someone like Samir Bensaad has a more international",1,,,,0,0

Okay, I need to find out the typical probation period for new employees in Algeria before signing a formal contract. Let me start by recalling what I know about labor laws in Algeria. I remember that Algeria has labor laws governed by the Labor Code, which might specify probation periods. 

First, I should check if there's a standard duration set by law. From what I've read before, many countries have a probation period ranging from one to three months. However, I need to confirm if Algeria has a specific regulation. 

I think in some Middle Eastern countries, the probation period can be up to two months, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the Labor Code in Algeria allows employers and employees to agree on a probation period. If there's no specific legal mandate, it might be negotiable. However, there could be a maximum limit set by law. 

I should also consider if there are any sources or official documents that state this. For example, the Algerian Ministry of Labor or legal resources. If I can't find exact information, maybe the answer is that there's no fixed period, but it's typically agreed upon between the employer and employee, possibly up to a certain limit. But I need to be precise.

Wait, I found a reference once that mentioned the probation period in Algeria is usually between one to three months, but it's not legally mandated. However, the employer and employee can agree on the terms, but it can't exceed a certain period. Wait, maybe there's a maximum limit. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe the Labor Code doesn't specify a standard probation period, allowing employers and employees to agree on it, but it's common practice to have around one to two months. But without a specific law, the answer might be that there's no set duration, but it's typically agreed upon. However, the user is asking for a typical duration, so maybe the common practice is around one month, but I need to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps the probation period is up to two months as per some sources. I think I need to check if there's a standard answer here. Since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. In some sources, it's mentioned that in Algeria, the probation period is usually one month, but it can vary. However, I'm not 100% certain.

New-gr-08,What type of alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what type of alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Algeria. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Algeria has a significant population of Muslims, and Islam prohibits the consumption of alcohol. However, there are also Christian and Jewish communities, as well as some secular individuals who might consume alcohol. But festivals in Algeria... Wait, Algeria has various festivals, both cultural and religious. For example, the national holidays like Independence Day, or cultural events. But during religious festivals like Ramadan, alcohol consumption is avoided. However, during other festivals, maybe people from different backgrounds attend.

But I need to consider the legal aspect. Algeria has strict laws against alcohol, but it's not entirely banned. Wine and beer are available, but they are expensive and not widely consumed. However, in some regions, especially in the Kabylie area, there's a tradition of producing and consuming wine. Maybe that's a clue.

Wait, but the question is about festivals. If festivals in Algeria are more secular, perhaps people might consume alcohol, but given the cultural and religious context, maybe it's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the most common alcoholic drink is beer or wine, but I need to confirm.

Another angle: looking at the alcohol consumption trends in Algeria. According to some sources, the consumption of alcohol is low compared to other countries, but when people do consume, beer is more common than spirits or wine. However, I'm not sure if that's specific to festivals.

Wait, but maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific alcoholic drink commonly consumed at festivals because of cultural and religious factors. However, the user is expecting a single answer. Maybe the answer is that alcohol consumption is not common, but the question is phrased as ""most commonly consumed,"" implying there is one. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that it's not widely consumed, but the user might be expecting a specific drink like beer or wine.

Alternatively, perhaps in some festivals, especially those with a more secular or Western influence, beer is consumed. But I need to be cautious here. Since the user wants the answer in a JSON list, and the question is about the most common type. Maybe the answer is that it's not common, but the user might expect a specific drink. However, given the cultural context, perhaps the answer is that no specific alcoholic drink is commonly consumed due to cultural and religious reasons. But the user might be expecting a different answer.

Th-en-11,Who is the most popular sportperson in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking who the most popular sportsperson in Algeria is. Let me think about this. Algeria has a rich sporting culture, but which athlete is the most popular? First, I should consider the sports that are most popular in the country. Football (soccer) is definitely the top sport there. So, maybe a football player.

Now, thinking about Algerian footballers who have gained international recognition. There's Zinedine Zidane, but he's French, though he has Algerian heritage. However, he's not considered an Algerian national team player. Then there's players like Riyad Mahrez. He's a current professional player, plays for Manchester City and the Algerian national team. He's been quite successful, winning titles and being a key player for Algeria. 

Another name that comes to mind is Islam Slimani. He's also played for the national team and had a notable career, but maybe not as prominent as Mahrez recently. There's also Karim Benzema, but again, he's French, not Algerian. 

Wait, I should confirm if Mahrez is indeed the most popular. He's been capped over 100 times for Algeria and was part of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations squad. His performances in the Premier League and for Algeria might make him a top choice. However, there's also the possibility of other athletes in different sports, like athletes in boxing or athletics. But in terms of popularity, footballers usually have a broader following.

Another angle: maybe the most popular is someone who has won major titles or has a significant fan base. Riyad Mahrez has won the Premier League, EFL Cup, and FA Cup with Manchester City, which would contribute to his popularity. Also, he's a key player for Algeria in international competitions.

I should check if there's any other athlete who might be more popular. For example, in boxing, there's Idris Aberkane, but I don't think he's as widely recognized as a footballer. In athletics, there's Hicham El Guerrouj, who was a famous runner, but he's from Morocco, not Algeria. Wait, no, Hicham El Guerrouj is Moroccan. Algeria has athletes like Taoufik Makhloufi in athletics, but again, not sure if he's more popular than Mahrez.

So, considering all that, the most popular sportsperson in Algeria is likely Riy",1,,,,1,1.0

Al-en-04,What is the most popular fruit in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular fruit in Algeria is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algeria's agriculture and common fruits there. Algeria is a country in North Africa, and their climate is mostly arid or semi-arid, with some Mediterranean influences in the north.

I know that citrus fruits like oranges and lemons are commonly grown in the Mediterranean regions, so maybe those are popular. Also, dates are significant in the Middle East and North Africa, so Algeria might produce dates too. Another fruit that comes to mind is the fig, which is common in the Mediterranean area. Then there's the pomegranate, which is also grown in that region. 

I should check if there are any specific fruits that are more prominent in Algeria. Maybe I should think about common fruits in the local diet. For example, in many North African countries, dates are used in traditional dishes and are a staple. However, I'm not sure if they are the most popular in terms of consumption or production. 

Another angle: looking at production statistics. If I remember correctly, Algeria's main fruits include citrus, grapes, olives, and dates. But which one is the most popular? ""Popular"" could mean consumed the most, exported the most, or culturally significant. 

I think oranges are a major crop in Algeria. They have large citrus plantations, especially in the north. Dates are also important, but maybe not as much as citrus. Alternatively, maybe grapes are popular for wine, but I'm not sure if that's the case. 

Wait, I should also consider local preferences. In many Arab countries, dates are a popular fruit, often eaten as a snack or used in desserts. However, in terms of production volume, citrus might be higher. 

I need to verify which one is more prevalent. A quick search in my mind: Algeria's top fruits are citrus (oranges, lemons), grapes, dates, and figs. Among these, oranges are probably the most produced and consumed. However, I'm not entirely certain. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is dates because they are a traditional fruit and widely consumed. But I need to be careful here. 

Another thought: in some sources, it's mentioned that Algeria is one of the top producers of dates in the world. But again, popularity might be different from production. 

Hmm, perhaps the most popular fruit in terms of both production and consumption is the date. But I'm not 100%",1,,,,1,1.0
New-gr-06,What is the most popular food in Algeria among young people?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular food in Algeria is among young people. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algerian cuisine. Traditional dishes include things like couscous, tagine, and various stews. But the question is specifically about young people's preferences.

I should consider that while traditional foods are important, younger generations might have different tastes. Maybe they're influenced by global trends or have a preference for convenience. Fast food chains like McDonald's or KFC might be popular, but I'm not sure if that's the case in Algeria.

Alternatively, there might be local fast food options that are more popular. For example, I've heard of places serving items like merguez (spicy sausage) or chakchoukha (a dish with semolina and meat). Also, street food could be a big deal. Maybe items like falafel, which are common in North Africa, or maybe even pizza from local pizzerias.

Another angle: Algerian youth might enjoy a mix of traditional and modern. For example, couscous is a staple, but maybe they prefer it with a twist. Or perhaps they're into snacks like pastilla (a savory pie) or various types of bread with different spreads.

Wait, but I need to find the most popular. I should check if there are any surveys or articles about this. From what I remember, in some contexts, dishes like ""chakchoukha"" or ""brik"" (a fried pancake with egg and tuna) are popular. However, I'm not certain if these are the top choices among young people specifically.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dessert like ""baklava"" or ""milk bread"" (khobz bel laban), but those are more traditional. I think the answer might be couscous, but I'm not sure if that's the case for young people. Maybe they prefer more modern or fusion dishes.

Wait, I should also think about the influence of French cuisine since Algeria was a French colony. Items like baguettes, quiche, or other French-inspired dishes might be common, but again, not sure about popularity among youth.

Another thought: street food is often popular among younger people. So maybe items like ""soukouss"" (a type of bread) with various toppings, or ""tajine"" in a more modern form. But I'm not certain.

I think I need to make an educated guess here. Cous",1,,,,1,1.0

Ne-ar-36,What is a typical festive meal in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about a typical festive meal in Algeria. Let me think. I need to recall what Algerian cuisine is like, especially during festivals. I know that during holidays like Eid or weddings, they have special dishes.

First, I remember that couscous is a staple in Algeria. It's often made with meat, like lamb or chicken, and various vegetables. Then there's the dessert, maybe something like baklava? Wait, baklava is common in many Middle Eastern countries too. What's specific to Algeria? Oh, maybe ""chakchouka,"" but that's more of a breakfast dish. 

Wait, for festive meals, they might serve ""tajine,"" which is a slow-cooked stew. But tajine is more of a general North African dish. Then there's ""msitla,"" which is a type of sweet pastry. Or ""ghriba,"" another sweet. But I'm not sure if those are specifically festive. 

Also, during Eid, they might have ""briouats,"" which are filled pastries. Or ""sfeeha,"" but that's more like a flatbread with fillings. Maybe ""chermoula"" as a sauce? No, that's more of a seasoning. 

Wait, I think the main dish is definitely couscous with meat and vegetables. For dessert, maybe ""baklava"" or ""m'hanncha,"" which is a type of sweet made with almonds and honey. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, ""kheer"" is a rice pudding, but that's more common in South Asia. 

Putting it all together, the typical festive meal would include couscous with lamb or chicken, served with vegetables, and then desserts like baklava or m'hanncha. I should check if there are other dishes commonly served. Maybe ""couscous royal"" which is a special version with more ingredients. Also, bread like ""khobz"" might be served. 

But the user wants a list in JSON format, one single answer. So the answer should be a list of the main components. I think the key items are couscous with meat, vegetables, and a dessert like baklava or m'hanncha. Maybe also mention the use of spices like cumin and saffron.

Th-en-37,"At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Algeria? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the typical age at which children become independent from their parents in Algeria. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall any information I have about cultural norms in Algeria regarding children's independence. Algeria is a country in North Africa with a culture that is influenced by both Arab and Berber traditions. In many Middle Eastern and North African countries, the age at which children leave home can vary, but it's often later than in Western countries. 

I remember that in some Arab countries, it's common for children to stay with their parents until they get married, which might be around late teens or early twenties. However, I should check if there are any specific factors in Algeria that might influence this. For example, economic factors, education levels, urban vs. rural differences, or societal expectations.

Also, considering that in many parts of the world, the age of independence can be influenced by education. If children pursue higher education, they might stay longer. In Algeria, higher education is common, so maybe that affects the age. However, I'm not sure of exact statistics.

Another angle is to look at general trends. In some studies, the average age for leaving home in countries like Algeria might be around 18-25. But I need to be careful not to generalize. Maybe there's a common belief or cultural norm that children stay until marriage, which is typically around 20-25. 

Wait, but the question is about becoming independent, not necessarily getting married. Independence might involve moving out, starting a job, etc. In some cases, even if they don't move out, they might be financially independent. However, the question is about becoming independent from parents, which usually implies moving out and living on their own.

I think in many Arab countries, the average age is around 25. But I need to confirm if that's the case for Algeria specifically. If I don't have exact data, maybe I should go with the most commonly cited figure. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to other North African countries. For example, in Morocco, the average is around 20-25. Algeria might be similar.

But since the user is asking for a specific answer, and I need to provide an Arabic numeral. If I can't find exact data, I might have to make an educated guess based on cultural norms. Let's say around 20-25. But which number is more typical? Maybe 21 or",1,,,,1,1.0

Ji-ko-35,What is the most common form of private education in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the most common form of private education in Algeria. Hmm. I need to recall what I know about education systems in Algeria.

First, Algeria has a public education system, but the question is about private education. Private schools in Algeria might include different types. I remember that in many countries, private schools can be religious or secular. But in Algeria, which is a Muslim-majority country, there might be a significant number of religiously affiliated private schools. However, I also know that there are private schools that follow the French curriculum, since Algeria was a French colony. These are often called ""lycées privés"" or something similar. 

Wait, but the most common form. Are there more French-based private schools or Islamic private schools? I think the French system is more prevalent because of historical ties. However, there's also the possibility of international schools, but those might be less common. Alternatively, maybe there are private schools that follow the Algerian public curriculum but are privately run. 

But I need to be precise. Let me think. In Algeria, private education is often associated with the French curriculum, especially in urban areas. These schools are usually called ""écoles privées"" and they might be run by religious organizations or private entities. However, I'm not sure if they are the most common. Another angle: the government allows private education, but the majority might still follow the national curriculum. But I think that the most common form is private schools that follow the French system, which is different from the public system. 

Wait, but maybe the most common is actually the Islamic private schools, which are affiliated with religious institutions. However, I'm not certain. Another source of confusion: sometimes private schools in Algeria are referred to as ""lycées privés"" which are similar to the public lycées but private. 

Alternatively, there's the concept of ""écoles religieuses"" which are religious schools. However, the majority of private schools might be secular, following the French model. 

I think the answer is that the most common form of private education in Algeria is the private schools following the French curriculum, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply ""private schools"" in general, but the question asks for the most common form, implying a specific type. 

Wait, I found in some sources that the majority of private schools in Algeria are those that follow the French educational system, which is different from the public",1,,,,1,1.0
Al-en-01,What is a common snack for preschool kids in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out a common snack for preschool kids in Algeria. Let me start by thinking about typical Algerian foods. Algeria is in North Africa, so their cuisine might have similarities with other North African countries like Morocco or Tunisia.

I know that in many Arab countries, dates are a common snack. Maybe they have something similar. Also, pastries and sweets are popular. For kids, something sweet and easy to eat. Maybe something like ""Baklava"" but that's more of a dessert. Wait, there's a snack called ""Msemen"" which is a type of flatbread, but I'm not sure if that's for kids.

Another thought: Algerian cuisine includes a lot of fruits. Maybe they have fresh fruits like oranges or grapes as snacks. Or maybe something like ""Koukourou,"" which is a type of bread. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, there's a snack called ""Chakchouka,"" but that's a dish, not a snack.

Wait, maybe ""Harira"" is a soup, not a snack. Let me think about street foods. ""Makouda"" is a type of snack made from chickpea flour, but that's more of a savory item. For preschoolers, something sweet is more likely. Maybe ""Aamal,"" which is a type of sweet made from semolina and honey. Or ""Briouat,"" which are fried pastries filled with meat or almonds, but again, not sure if that's common for kids.

Alternatively, maybe simple things like sandwiches with cheese or peanut butter. But I need to be specific. Another angle: looking up common Algerian snacks for children. Wait, I can't look it up, but I can use general knowledge. In many Middle Eastern and North African countries, dates are commonly given as snacks. So maybe dates are a common snack for kids there. Alternatively, maybe something like ""Kheer"" (a rice pudding), but that's more of a dessert.

Wait, I think ""Baklava"" is a possibility, but it's rich. Maybe ""Majbousa,"" which is a sweet made from semolina and sugar, sometimes with nuts. Or ""Msemen"" with honey. Alternatively, ""Ouzer"" is a type of sweet, but that's a drink. 

Alternatively, thinking about common snacks in schools, maybe something like chocolate or candy, but that's too generic. Maybe ""M",1,,,,1,0.5

New-su-58,What animals are commonly used for agriculture in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what animals are commonly used for agriculture in Algeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algerian agriculture. Algeria's agriculture is probably influenced by its climate and geography. They have a Mediterranean climate in some areas and more arid regions in others.

First, I know that in many countries, livestock like cattle, sheep, and goats are common for agriculture. Algeria might have similar practices. Also, camels are associated with North Africa, but are they used in agriculture specifically? Maybe for transportation rather than farming. But I should check.

Then there's the use of animals for plowing or pulling carts. Oxen are often used in traditional farming. So maybe cattle or oxen are part of the answer. Also, sheep and goats are common in regions where grazing is possible, like the Atlas Mountains or other rural areas. 

Poultry might be another category. Chickens are raised for eggs and meat, so that's probably included. Horses could be used for certain tasks, but I'm not sure how common they are in agriculture compared to other animals. 

Wait, I should also consider the main agricultural activities in Algeria. They grow crops like wheat, barley, olives, and fruits. For these, animals might be used for plowing, irrigation, or transporting goods. So animals like donkeys or mules might be used for labor. But I'm not certain about that. 

Another angle: looking at the traditional livestock in North Africa. Sheep, goats, and camels are traditional, but camels are more for desert regions. Algeria has both desert and Mediterranean areas. So maybe sheep and goats are more common in the mountainous or semi-arid regions. 

Also, dairy farming might involve cows or goats. So cattle for milk production. Poultry is definitely a part of small-scale farming. 

Putting it all together, the main animals would likely be cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry. Maybe donkeys or horses for labor, but I'm not sure if they are considered ""used for agriculture"" in the same way as livestock for meat or milk. The question says ""commonly used for agriculture,"" which could include both livestock and draft animals. But the example answer in the user's JSON might expect the most common ones. 

I think the answer is cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry. Let me verify if there are any other animals. Maybe horses, but I'm not sure. To be safe, I'll stick with the most common ones",1,,,,1,1.0

Na-ko-33,What symbolic food do people from Algeria eat on (Lunar) New Year?,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking about the symbolic food that people from Algeria eat on Lunar New Year. First, I need to recall if Algeria celebrates Lunar New Year. Wait, Lunar New Year is primarily a Chinese holiday, but some other countries with significant Chinese communities might also celebrate it. Algeria is a country in North Africa, and I know that the majority of the population is Muslim, so they follow Islamic holidays like Ramadan and Eid. But does Algeria have a significant Chinese community that celebrates Lunar New Year?

I think there might be some Chinese expatriates or communities in Algeria, especially in cities like Algiers, but I'm not sure how widespread the celebration of Lunar New Year is there. If they do celebrate it, what foods would they eat? Typically, Lunar New Year foods in China include things like dumplings, fish, spring rolls, and glutinous rice cakes. But if the question is about Algeria specifically, maybe there's a local dish that's symbolic for them during this time. However, I can't recall any traditional Algerian food specifically tied to Lunar New Year. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick because Algeria doesn't traditionally celebrate Lunar New Year, so there might not be a symbolic food associated with it. But the user is asking for an answer, so perhaps the assumption is that there is one. Maybe the user is confused, thinking that all countries have a New Year food, but in reality, Lunar New Year is not a widely observed holiday in Algeria. 

Wait, but the user mentioned ""(Lunar) New Year"" in parentheses, which might mean they are referring to the Lunar New Year, not the Gregorian New Year. So, if people in Algeria do celebrate Lunar New Year, perhaps they adopt some Chinese customs, but I don't have information on that. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken, and the actual answer is that Algeria does not have a traditional symbolic food for Lunar New Year because it's not a part of their cultural calendar. 

However, the user is expecting an answer, so I need to check if there's any possible connection. Maybe the user is conflating different cultures. For example, in some North African countries, there are dishes like couscous, which is a staple. But couscous is not specifically tied to Lunar New Year. Another possibility is that the user is referring to the general New Year, not Lunar, but the question specifically says Lunar.

Ji-ko-36,Which subject’s academy/private educational institute do middle or high students most frequently attend in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Algeria attend most frequently.

First, I need to think about the common subjects that have private tutoring or academies. In many countries, subjects like math, science, and languages are commonly tutored. But Algeria's education system might have specific trends.

Algeria's curriculum includes subjects like Arabic, French, math, physics, chemistry, and maybe religious education. Since the education system is influenced by both French and Arabic, French might be a key subject. However, math and science are often areas where students seek extra help because they are challenging.

I should consider if there are any cultural or systemic factors. For example, if the official language is Arabic but French is widely used in education, students might need help with French. Alternatively, if exams in subjects like math or science are particularly tough, those could be the ones with more private institutes.

I remember that in some countries, English is a popular subject for private tutoring, but in Algeria, maybe French is more prevalent because it's the language of instruction in many schools. However, I'm not entirely sure. I should verify if there's data or common knowledge about this.

Wait, maybe looking at the structure of the education system in Algeria. Middle and high school students prepare for the baccalaureate (Bac), which is crucial for university admission. Subjects like math, physics, and chemistry are part of the Bac, so students might attend private institutes for these to improve their scores.

But I need to be precise. Are there any reports or studies indicating the most common subjects for private tutoring in Algeria? Without specific data, I might have to make an educated guess based on common patterns.

In many countries, math and science are the top subjects for private tutoring. Given that, and considering the importance of the Bac, it's possible that math and science are the most frequently attended. However, the question specifies a single subject, but the answer format allows a list. Wait, the user says ""one single answer as a list form,"" so maybe multiple subjects.

But the original question is phrased as ""which subject's academy,"" so maybe the answer is a single subject. However, the example answer in the JSON allows a list. Maybe in Algeria, multiple subjects are common, but which one is the most frequent?

Th-en-51,Which subject is considered the most important for students in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Algeria. Let me think about this.

First, I need to consider the educational priorities in Algeria. The country's education system is influenced by its history and current socio-economic factors. Algeria has a strong emphasis on STEM fields, especially engineering and sciences, because of their role in the country's development, particularly in sectors like energy and technology.

But wait, there's also the national curriculum. In many countries, subjects like mathematics and sciences are foundational. However, in Algeria, Arabic and Islamic studies are also very important due to the cultural and religious context. However, the question is about the most important subject for students, which might relate to academic focus or career prospects.

Looking at the national exams, like the Baccalaureate, which is crucial for university admission. The subjects that are prioritized there might indicate importance. Engineering, sciences, and mathematics are often emphasized because they are prerequisites for higher education and jobs in key industries.

Another angle: the government's policies. Algeria has been pushing for technological advancement and self-reliance, which might prioritize STEM education. However, there's also a focus on humanities and social sciences for developing critical thinking.

But I need to check if there's a consensus or official data. Since I can't access current data, I'll rely on general knowledge. In many Arab countries, mathematics and sciences are considered crucial for academic and professional success. However, in Algeria's case, given its oil and gas industry, engineering and sciences might be more emphasized.

Wait, but the user wants a single answer. Which one is most important? Maybe mathematics, as it's a foundational subject for many fields. Alternatively, Arabic, as the national language. But I think in terms of academic and career importance, sciences and mathematics might be more critical.

But looking at the structure of the education system, the Baccalaureate includes different tracks: scientific, literary, and technical. The scientific track is often seen as more prestigious and leads to engineering or medical fields, which are highly valued. Therefore, subjects in the scientific track, like mathematics, physics, and chemistry, are considered most important.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is Arabic, but I think the emphasis on STEM fields in Algeria's education system makes sciences and mathematics the most important. However, the question asks for a single subject. Which one?

Wait, perhaps the answer is Mathematics. Because it's a core subject in all tracks and foundational for other sciences. Or maybe",1,,,,1,1.0

Ji-ko-37,What type of clothing do middle and high school students wear to school in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what clothing middle and high school students in Algeria typically wear to school. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algeria's culture and education system.

Algeria is a Muslim-majority country in North Africa, so religious and cultural norms probably influence school dress codes. In many Islamic countries, modesty is emphasized, especially for girls. So, I'd expect girls to wear longer skirts or dresses that cover the knees, maybe with a headscarf (hijab) depending on the school's policies. Boys might wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, avoiding short or revealing clothing.

I should also consider if there are government regulations. I remember that Algeria has had policies promoting modest dress in schools, especially after some controversies. For example, in 2017, there was a law requiring girls to wear the hijab in public schools, but I'm not sure if that's still in effect or if it's enforced in all regions. However, some schools might have their own rules, and there could be variations between urban and rural areas or different types of schools (public vs. private).

Another angle is the climate. Algeria has a Mediterranean climate in the north and more arid in the south. So, clothing might be lighter in warmer regions, but still modest. Maybe girls wear long skirts or dresses that are not too tight, and boys wear long pants and shirts. Shorts might be prohibited unless it's very hot, but I'm not certain.

I should also think about uniforms. Some schools might have uniforms, but others might not. If there's no uniform, students might dress in traditional or modest clothing. However, the question is about general clothing types, not specific uniforms. So the answer would focus on the typical modest attire rather than a specific uniform.

Wait, but the user asked for middle and high school students. In some cases, there might be differences between younger and older students, but I think the general modesty rules apply across all levels. Also, considering that Algeria's education system is influenced by French colonial history, but the dress code is more aligned with Islamic norms now.

Putting this all together, the answer would mention modest clothing for both genders, with girls wearing skirts or dresses that cover the knees and possibly headscarves, and boys wearing long pants and shirts. However, I need to make sure that the information is current. If the 2017 law is still in place, then the hijab would be required, but if there",1,,,,0,0

New-as-20,What is the most popular indoor sport in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Algeria is. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Algeria. Algeria is a country in North Africa, and like many countries, they have a variety of sports. But the question is specifically about indoor sports.

First, I should think about the major sports that are popular in Algeria. I know that football (soccer) is a huge sport there. But football is typically played outdoors on a field, so maybe that's not the answer. However, sometimes indoor versions of sports exist. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to sports that are primarily played indoors. So, perhaps something like basketball, volleyball, or table tennis?

I should check if there are any indoor sports that are particularly popular in Algeria. Maybe I should consider the climate. Algeria has a Mediterranean climate in the north and a more arid climate in the south. So, during hot summers, people might prefer indoor sports. But I'm not sure about the specific sports.

I remember that in many countries, basketball is popular, but I'm not sure about Algeria. Also, there's handball, which is played indoors. Handball might be popular in Algeria. Let me think about the national teams. Algeria has a national handball team, and they might have a good following. Alternatively, maybe table tennis or badminton? But those might not be as popular.

Another angle: looking at the Olympic Games. Algeria has participated in the Olympics, and they have athletes in various sports. For example, they have had success in boxing, wrestling, and maybe handball. But again, I'm not sure about the indoor aspect.

Wait, maybe I should consider the infrastructure. If there are a lot of indoor sports facilities in Algeria, that might indicate which sports are popular. For example, if there are many basketball courts or handball halls, that could be a clue. But without specific data, this is hard.

Alternatively, maybe looking at cultural factors. In some countries, sports like volleyball or basketball are more popular indoors. But I'm not certain about Algeria. I might need to rely on general knowledge. From what I recall, handball is a popular sport in North Africa, including Algeria. It's played indoors, and the Algerian national team has been competitive in international competitions. So maybe handball is the answer.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another possibility is that football is the most popular sport overall, but since the question",1,,,,1,1.0

New-in-01,Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Algeria. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I should consider the coffee culture in Algeria. I know that Algeria has a strong tradition of coffee drinking, especially with traditional methods like Turkish coffee. But the question is about a specific brand.

I'm not sure if there's a well-known international chain that's popular there. Maybe Starbucks? But I think Starbucks might not have a presence in Algeria. Wait, I remember that Algeria has some local coffee shops, but I'm not certain about their names. Alternatively, maybe there's a brand that's more established locally. 

I should check if there are any major coffee shop chains in Algeria. I know that in many Middle Eastern and North African countries, there are local cafes that are popular. However, sometimes international brands like Starbucks or Costa Coffee might be present. But I'm not sure about their popularity in Algeria specifically. 

Another angle: maybe the user is referring to a local brand that's more popular than international ones. But I can't recall specific names. Maybe there's a chain like ""Café de l'Escargot"" or something similar, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that there's no single dominant brand, but the user wants the most popular one. 

Wait, I think I've heard that in Algeria, traditional coffee houses are more common, and maybe there's not a single brand that's the most popular. However, if I have to choose, maybe there's a local chain like ""Café Central"" or ""Café de l'Université"" but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a brand from a neighboring country that's popular there. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that there isn't a single most popular brand, but the user requires an answer. Since I don't have specific data, maybe the answer is that there's no dominant international chain, and local cafes are more prevalent. However, the user might expect a specific name. 

Wait, I found in previous knowledge that there isn't a widely recognized single coffee shop brand in Algeria that's the most popular. However, if I have to provide an answer, maybe the answer is that there's no single most popular brand, but the user might expect a specific name. Alternatively, maybe ""Café de l'Escargot"" is a local chain, but I'm not sure.

New-gr-58,Which job is considered underpaid in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which job is considered underpaid in Algeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Algerian economy and job market. Algeria has a significant public sector, and many jobs there are government-related. However, there have been reports of public sector employees facing issues like delayed salaries or inflation eroding their purchasing power.

I remember reading that teachers and healthcare workers often face challenges with their pay. But wait, maybe it's more specific. Let me think about recent news. There was a strike by public sector workers a few years back due to salary disputes. That might indicate that public sector jobs are underpaid.

Another angle: in many countries, jobs in the public sector can sometimes be seen as underpaid compared to private sector roles, especially if the private sector is booming. However, in Algeria, the private sector might not be as developed, so maybe the issue is different. Alternatively, maybe certain professions like teachers or civil servants are underpaid because of budget constraints or corruption.

Wait, there's also the issue of inflation. If salaries aren't adjusted for inflation, even if they were once adequate, they might now be considered underpaid. So, public sector jobs like teachers, doctors, or other civil servants might be the answer here. But I need to confirm if there's a specific job that's commonly cited.

Alternatively, maybe it's not just public sector. Maybe jobs in certain industries, like agriculture or manual labor, are underpaid. But the question might be looking for a more specific role. Let me check if there's a commonly mentioned profession in Algerian context.

Upon reflection, I think the public sector jobs, particularly teachers and healthcare workers, are often cited as underpaid due to delayed payments and low salaries relative to the cost of living. However, the user wants a single answer in a list. Maybe the most commonly mentioned is public sector workers in general, but if I have to pick one, perhaps teachers? Or maybe the answer is more general. Wait, the user said ""one single answer as a list form"" but the example shows a list with one item. So the answer should be a list with one item.

But I need to be accurate. Let me see. In Algeria, the public sector has been a major employer, but salaries have not kept up with inflation. So, public sector jobs are considered underpaid. However, the answer might be more specific. For example, in some contexts, teachers are considered underpaid. But I'm not sure if",1,,,,1,0.5

New-ch-73,What type of clubs are most popular among university students in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what types of clubs are most popular among university students in Algeria. Let me start by thinking about the cultural and social context of Algeria. Algeria is a country with a strong emphasis on education, and universities there are quite prominent. Students often engage in extracurricular activities to complement their studies.

First, I should consider common student interests. In many countries, cultural, sports, and academic clubs are popular. But Algeria has its own unique aspects. For example, Arabic and Islamic culture are significant, so maybe there are clubs related to that. Also, since Algeria has a history of political activism, perhaps there are clubs focused on social or political issues. However, I should be careful here because political clubs might not be as openly popular due to potential restrictions.

Another angle is the influence of French culture, given Algeria's colonial history. Maybe there are clubs related to French language or culture. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, since many Algerians are interested in technology and entrepreneurship, there could be tech or innovation clubs.

I should also think about the availability of resources. In some universities, clubs might be more about what's feasible. For example, sports clubs like football (soccer) are universally popular. Maybe cultural clubs that celebrate Algerian traditions, such as music, dance, or literature. Academic clubs like debate teams or science clubs could also be prevalent.

Wait, but I need to verify if these are actually the most popular. Maybe I should look for any existing data or studies. However, since I can't access external information, I have to rely on general knowledge. In many Arab countries, Islamic clubs or societies are common, but I'm not certain about Algeria specifically. Also, there might be student unions or organizations that focus on representing student interests.

Another thought: in Algeria, higher education is highly competitive, so academic support clubs like study groups or tutoring might be popular. But that's more of a study group than a club. Alternatively, clubs that help with career development, like resume building or internship opportunities.

Considering all these factors, the most probable answer would include cultural, sports, and academic clubs. But to narrow it down, maybe cultural and sports clubs are the most popular. However, I need to make sure. Since I can't confirm, I'll go with the most common categories that are generally popular in similar regions: cultural, sports, and academic clubs. But perhaps in Algeria, cultural clubs related to national identity and sports like football are",1,,,,1,1.0

New-en-05,Which food is a cost-effective and quick meal option in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which food in Algeria is both cost-effective and quick to make. Let me think about Algerian cuisine. First, I need to recall common dishes that are popular there. Couscous comes to mind. It's a staple, right? But is it quick? Well, preparing couscous can take some time because you have to cook the semolina and then the stew. Maybe not the quickest.

Then there's chorba, which is a soup. Soups can be quick if you have prepped ingredients. But I'm not sure if it's the most cost-effective. What about flatbreads like khobz? They are common and cheap, but they might not be a full meal on their own.

Wait, there's also dishes like merguez, which are spicy sausages. They can be grilled quickly, but maybe they're more of a snack or part of a meal. What about eggs? Scrambled eggs are quick and cheap, but maybe not specific to Algeria.

Oh, maybe ""chakchouka""? That's a North African dish with eggs in a tomato sauce. It's quick and uses simple ingredients. But is it common in Algeria? Or perhaps ""tajine"" with eggs? Not sure.

Another thought: ""Brik"" is a type of stuffed pancake, but it might be more of a street food and could be a bit time-consuming to make at home. 

Wait, there's also ""Mechoui,"" which is roasted lamb, but that's more of a special occasion dish and not quick or cheap. 

Let me think again. The most common and affordable meals in Algeria are probably based on staples like wheat, beans, and vegetables. Couscous is a big one, but as I thought earlier, it takes time. Maybe there's a quicker version? Or maybe a dish that uses leftovers?

Alternatively, ""Harira"" is a soup, but again, not sure about the time. What about ""Msemen,"" which is a type of flatbread? It's quick to cook once made, but preparing the dough takes time.

Wait, perhaps ""Dolma"" (stuffed vegetables) but that's more time-consuming. 

Hold on, maybe the answer is couscous, even if it's not the quickest, because it's very cost-effective and a staple. Or maybe there's another dish. Let me check my knowledge again.

In Algeria, ""Couscous"" is a",1,,,,1,0.3333333333333333

Sa-en-7,What are popular snacks in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what popular snacks are in Algeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algerian cuisine. Algeria is a North African country, so their snacks might be similar to other Maghreb countries like Morocco or Tunisia. Common ingredients there include olives, dates, nuts, and various types of bread.

I remember that ""Brik"" is a popular snack in Algeria. It's a type of fried pastry filled with egg, tuna, or sometimes meat. Then there's ""Msemen,"" which is a layered flatbread, often eaten with butter or jam. Another one could be ""Khobz,"" which is a type of bread, but maybe not a snack per se. Wait, maybe ""Chakchouka"" is more of a dish than a snack. 

Oh, ""Fenouil"" is a type of candy made from aniseed, which is popular in Algeria. Also, ""Makroud"" are date-filled pastries, often made during Ramadan. ""Bourek"" is another possibility, which is a flaky pastry filled with cheese or meat. ""Tajine"" is a slow-cooked dish, but that's more of a main meal. 

Wait, ""Doughnuts"" like ""Bellel"" might be a snack. Also, ""Majbousa"" is a sweet semolina cake, but I'm not sure if it's a snack. Maybe ""Ghriba"" which are sesame seed cookies. ""Touareg"" is a type of bread, but again, not sure about the snack category. 

I should verify if these are indeed considered snacks. Brik and Bourek are definitely street foods. Fenouil and Makroud are sweets. Maybe ""Baklava"" as well, but that's more common in the Middle East. ""Sfenj"" is a fried dough ball, similar to a donut, which is a popular snack. 

Putting it all together, the popular snacks would include Brik, Sfenj, Fenouil, Makroud, Bourek, and maybe Ghriba. I should check if there are others. Oh, ""Kseff"" is a type of sweet made from wheat, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""Msemen"" is eaten with honey or jam, so maybe that's a snack.

Kik-in-36,Who is the most popular soccer coach in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular soccer coach in Algeria is. Let me start by recalling any Algerian coaches I know. There's probably someone who has had a lot of success with the national team or a top club.

First, I remember that Algeria has a strong national team, the ""Fennecs."" They had a good run in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, reaching the final. The coach back then was Djamel Belmadi. He's a well-known name in Algerian football. But is he still the coach? I should check if he's still in charge of the national team or if there's been a change.

Wait, I think Belmadi was appointed in 2018 and led them to the AFCON final in 2019. After that, there might have been some changes. Let me think. In 2021, the Algerian Football Federation had some issues, and there was a change in coaches. But I'm not sure who took over. Maybe someone else took the position after Belmadi? Or did he stay?

Alternatively, maybe the most popular coach isn't the current national team coach but someone else who has had a significant impact. For example, there's Rachid Taïbi, who was the coach of the national team in the 1990s and led them to the 1990 World Cup. But that's a long time ago, so popularity might be more recent.

Another angle: club coaches. Algeria has top clubs like ES Setif, JS Kabylie, and USM Alger. If a club coach has had a lot of success, they might be popular. But I'm not sure which club coach is the most popular nationally. Maybe a coach who has won multiple league titles or continental competitions.

Wait, but the question is about the most popular, not necessarily the most successful. Popularity could be influenced by media presence, charisma, or success in big tournaments. Djamel Belmadi is still a prominent figure, even if he's not the current national team coach. Let me confirm his current status. As of 2023, I think he might have stepped down or been replaced. If I can't recall, maybe I should go with the most recent known coach.

Alternatively, if there's no clear answer, perhaps the most popular is still Belmadi due to his AFCON success. But I need to be careful not to",1,,,,1,1.0

Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular volleyball player in Algeria is. Let me start by recalling any names I know. I'm not super familiar with Algerian volleyball, but maybe there are some athletes who have gained recognition.

First, I should check if there are any prominent players from Algeria. Maybe they've participated in international competitions like the Olympics or World Championships. Let me think. I remember that Algeria has a national volleyball team, but I don't know the names of the players. 

Wait, sometimes athletes become popular through social media or national achievements. Maybe there's a player who's a team captain or has won significant awards. Alternatively, perhaps there are female players who have gained attention. 

I might need to look up recent information. However, since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on existing knowledge. I recall that in 2021, Algeria's women's volleyball team had some success in the African Championships. Maybe a player like Djamila Ait Ouarab? But I'm not sure if she's the most popular. 

Alternatively, there's a male player named Karim Benzema, but wait, no—he's a footballer, not volleyball. That's a mistake. I need to be careful. Maybe someone like Rachid Mekhloufi, but again, he's a football legend. 

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing sports. Let me think again. Maybe the most popular volleyball player is someone like Samir El Haddad? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps there's a player who has been active in the Algerian league and has a large following. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized player, and the popularity is more on the team level rather than individual players. But the question asks for an individual. 

Since I'm not sure, I might have to state that there isn't a single, widely recognized most popular player, or perhaps the answer is that information isn't readily available. However, the user expects a specific answer. Maybe the best approach is to mention that there isn't a single most popular player, or perhaps a specific name based on limited knowledge. But I need to be accurate. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting a placeholder answer, but since I can't verify, I should state that the information isn't available. But the instructions say to provide an answer. Maybe the most recent notable player is Djamila Ait Ouarab, but",1,,,,,

Jo-sp-13,What is the most popular water sport in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular water sport in Algeria is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algeria's geography and culture. Algeria is a country in North Africa, known for its Mediterranean coastline, which includes the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The country also has the Sahara Desert, but the coastal areas might be where water sports are more common.

Now, thinking about water sports, common ones include swimming, surfing, sailing, windsurfing, kayaking, and maybe even fishing. However, popularity can depend on local traditions, climate, and infrastructure. Since Algeria has a Mediterranean coast, sports like sailing or windsurfing could be popular because of the wind conditions. Also, maybe swimming is very common as a general activity, but is it considered a sport?

Wait, the question specifies a ""water sport,"" which usually implies a competitive or recreational activity that's more structured. Let me check if there's any specific sport that's prominent in Algeria. I might need to think about local events or if there's a national team in a particular sport. For example, does Algeria have a strong presence in sailing or windsurfing at the international level?

Alternatively, maybe it's something like fishing, but that's more of a subsistence activity than a sport. Or perhaps water skiing? I'm not sure. Another angle: considering the availability of water bodies. Algeria has the Mediterranean Sea, but also some lakes and rivers. The largest lake is Lake Chad, but that's in the central part of the country. However, Lake Chad is shared with several countries and might not be as accessible for sports.

Looking up in my mind, I remember that some North African countries have popularity in sports like windsurfing. For example, Egypt has some famous spots for windsurfing. Algeria might have similar opportunities along its coast. Also, the city of Oran is a major coastal city with a harbor, which could be a hub for water activities.

Another thought: maybe swimming is the most popular, but I'm not certain. However, the question is about a sport, so perhaps a more active sport. Maybe sailing? Let me think if there's any data or common knowledge about this. Alternatively, maybe it's not a traditional sport but something that's gained popularity in recent years.

Wait, I should also consider if there are any official sources or statistics. But since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on existing knowledge. In some Mediterranean countries, water sports like sailing, windsurf",1,,,,1,1.0

New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Algeria? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Algeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Algerian education system.

Middle school in Algeria is typically referred to as ""collège,"" which corresponds to grades 7 to 9, right? The curriculum there would include core subjects like mathematics, French, Arabic, science, history, geography, physical education, and maybe some arts or music. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact number.

Wait, I should consider the official curriculum. In many countries, middle school subjects can vary, but Algeria follows a standardized program. Let me think: the main subjects are usually Math, French, Arabic, Science (which might be split into physics and chemistry), History and Geography, Civic Education, Physical Education, Music, and maybe a foreign language like English. There could also be subjects like Information and Communication Technology (ICT) or Technical Education.

Wait, but some subjects might be combined. For example, Science might cover both physics and chemistry. Also, Civic Education is important in Algeria's curriculum. Let me count again:

1. Mathematics
2. French
3. Arabic
4. Science (could be split into Physics and Chemistry, but maybe counted as one subject)
5. History and Geography
6. Civic Education
7. Physical Education
8. Music
9. English or another foreign language
10. ICT
11. Technical Education or another subject

Hmm, that's 11. But I'm not sure if some of these are considered separate. For example, in some systems, Physics and Chemistry are separate, but in others, they're combined. Also, Technical Education might be part of the curriculum. Maybe there's also a subject like Religion or Ethics, but I think in Algeria, Islamic Education is part of the curriculum, so that's another subject.

So adding that, maybe 12 subjects. But I need to verify. Alternatively, checking a source might help, but since I can't access external information, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

Another angle: the Algerian middle school curriculum is standardized. From what I remember, the subjects include Math, French, Arabic, Science (Physics and Chemistry), History and Geography, Civic Education, Physical Education, Music, English, ICT, and Islamic Education. That's 11 subjects. But maybe some are grouped differently.

Ni-en-12,What is the top university in Algeria? (Provide the official name.),"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the top university in Algeria is and provide its official name. Let me start by recalling what I know about Algerian universities. Algeria has several well-known universities, but which one is considered the top?

I remember that the University of Algiers is a major institution. Wait, but there are different campuses or faculties under that name. Maybe the main one is the University of Algiers 1, also known as the University of Algiers. But I should check if there's another university that's ranked higher.

I think the University of Constantine might be another contender, but I'm not sure about its ranking. Also, there's the University of Oran and the University of Setif. However, traditionally, the University of Algiers has been the most prestigious. 

Wait, maybe I should consider recent rankings. Sometimes rankings can change. For example, the QS World University Rankings or other international rankings might list them, but I'm not certain about the latest data. However, in the absence of current data, the University of Algiers is often cited as the top in Algeria.

Another point: the official name. The University of Algiers is the main one, but does it have an official name in Arabic or French? The official name might be Université d'Alger, but in Arabic, it's جامعه الجزائر. However, the question asks for the official name, which is probably the French name since Algeria's official language is Arabic, but the universities often use French names due to historical reasons. 

Wait, the university's official name in French is Université d'Alger. However, there are different universities in Algiers, like Université d'Alger 1, 2, 3, etc. The main one is Université d'Alger 1, which is the oldest and most prestigious. 

But I need to confirm if the top university in Algeria is indeed Université d'Alger 1. Alternatively, maybe the University of Constantine is higher in some rankings. However, according to general knowledge and historical data, the University of Algiers (Université d'Alger) is the top. 

So, the answer should be the official name, which is ""Université d'Alger"". However, to be precise, it's ""Université d'Alger 1"" as the main campus. But sometimes the main one is just referred to as Université d'Alger. I need",1,,,,1,0.5
New-ha-08,What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Algeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a food that Algerian children typically dislike but the elderly enjoy.

First, I need to think about traditional Algerian dishes. Common foods include couscous, tagines, pastilla, and various stews. Now, considering what might be disliked by kids. Kids often prefer sweeter or milder flavors. Some dishes might have strong flavors or ingredients that aren't appealing to children.

One possibility is ""harira,"" a traditional soup made with tomatoes, lentils, chickpeas, and spices. It's a popular dish, especially during Ramadan. But would children dislike it? Maybe because of the strong spices or the texture. However, I'm not sure if it's specifically disliked by kids.

Another option is ""chermoula,"" a spicy marinade used in fish dishes. The spiciness might turn kids off, but the elderly might enjoy the bold flavors. However, chermoula is more of a seasoning than a standalone dish.

Wait, there's a dish called ""brik"" which is a crispy pastry filled with egg, tuna, or meat. Kids might not like the texture, but I don't think that's specific to the elderly.

What about ""mloukhia""? It's a green vegetable stew with a thick, mucilaginous texture. The slimy consistency might be unappealing to children, while the elderly might prefer it. That's a possibility. Another dish is ""roug el khoubz,"" a fermented bread that's tangy and strong. The fermented taste could be too much for kids but enjoyed by older people.

Alternatively, ""couscous"" itself is a staple, but I don't think it's disliked by children. Maybe certain types of stews with specific spices?

I recall that ""harira"" is often mentioned in the context of being a soup that's more for adults, maybe because of its complexity. But I'm not certain. Another angle: some Algerian dishes use preserved lemons or olives, which have strong flavors. Kids might not like those, but the elderly might.

Wait, ""l'houmous"" (hummus) is popular, but again, not sure about the dislike aspect. Maybe ""khebs"" (flatbread) with certain spreads? Not sure.

I think the most likely answer is ""mloukhia"" or ""roug el khoubz."" But I need to verify. Alternatively, """,1,,,,1,1.0

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking where high school students in Algeria usually go after dinner. First, I need to think about the typical daily routines of students in Algeria.

Algeria has a different cultural and educational structure compared to some other countries. High school students there might have specific habits. After dinner, which is usually around 8 PM or so, what do they do? In many countries, students might study, hang out with friends, or use their phones. But considering Algeria's context, maybe there's something more specific.

I should consider the education system. Algerian high school students might have homework or study sessions. But do they go to a specific place? Maybe they go to study groups at home, or perhaps they go to a library. Wait, but libraries might not be as common in some areas. Alternatively, in some cultures, students might go out with friends, but after dinner, maybe they stay home. Also, considering the time, if they have a curfew or family expectations, they might stay home. 

Another angle: Algeria has a strong emphasis on education, so studying might be a common activity. But the question is about where they go, not what they do. So if they study, it's probably at home. However, maybe they go to a friend's house. But is that common? Or maybe they attend religious activities, like going to a mosque, especially if they are Muslim, which is the majority religion. However, high school students might not go to the mosque after dinner unless it's a specific time for prayers. 

Alternatively, maybe they go to a cybercafé or internet café to do homework or socialize online. In some countries, internet cafes are common places for students to access the internet. But I'm not sure about Algeria specifically. 

Wait, another thought: in some Middle Eastern and North African countries, it's common for families to have dinner and then students might go to a public place like a park or a café. But I'm not certain about Algeria. 

Alternatively, considering that Algeria has a lot of family-oriented culture, students might stay home after dinner. So the answer could be home. But the question is about where they go, implying a place outside home. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the most accurate answer is that they go home, but that seems too obvious. Alternatively, they might go to study groups at home or with friends. But the answer should be in a list, so maybe [""home",1,,,,1,1.0
