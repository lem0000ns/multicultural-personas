New-ko-02,What is the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Ethiopia. Let me start by recalling what I know about prenatal care in Ethiopia. Ethiopia has a relatively low healthcare infrastructure compared to more developed countries, so prenatal education might focus on community-based programs.

I remember that in many African countries, traditional practices and community health workers play a big role. Maybe antenatal care (ANC) visits are common, but the question is about education activities, not just medical check-ups. Prenatal education could include things like classes, workshops, or counseling sessions.

I think Ethiopia's Ministry of Health has programs promoting maternal health. There's the Health Extension Program, which uses trained health workers to provide education at the community level. These workers might conduct sessions on nutrition, hygiene, danger signs during pregnancy, and childbirth preparation.

Another possibility is group education sessions, where pregnant women gather to learn from health professionals or trained peers. These sessions might cover topics like proper diet, exercise, and avoiding harmful practices. Also, radio programs or community talks could be a form of education, especially in rural areas with limited access to formal classes.

Wait, but the question asks for the most popular one. I've read before that in Ethiopia, antenatal education often includes information on family planning, nutrition, and identifying complications. However, the specific activity that's most popular might be the regular antenatal care visits combined with educational sessions during those visits. But the user is asking for an activity, not a service.

Alternatively, maybe it's the use of health extension workers who provide home-based education. Or perhaps community-based prenatal classes. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the most cited answer in studies is that group prenatal education sessions are common, especially those led by trained health workers. Another angle is that in some regions, traditional birth attendants might provide education, but that's more traditional and less formal.

Alternatively, the distribution of educational materials like brochures or posters in health facilities. But again, the most popular activity would likely be structured educational sessions, either in groups or individually. Given that, I think the answer is that the most popular prenatal education activity is group antenatal education sessions provided by health extension workers or community health workers. But I need to make sure this is accurate.

Wait, I should check if there's any specific data. From what I recall, in Ethiopia, the Health Extension Program is a key component, and these workers do provide education on prenatal care. So the answer might be",1,,,,1,0.5
Ji-ko-29,Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Ethiopia's society?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Ethiopian society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian traditions and celebrations.

First, I know that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some African cultures, there are rites of passage for specific ages, like 13 or 21. But Ethiopia has its own unique traditions. I remember something about a ceremony called ""Kirtan"" or maybe ""Genna,"" but I'm not sure. Wait, Genna is more like a Christmas celebration, right? Maybe that's not it.

Another thought: Ethiopia has a tradition called ""Meskel,"" which is a religious holiday, but that's not a birthday. Then there's the Ethiopian New Year, which is called ""Enkutatash,"" celebrated in September. But that's a New Year, not a birthday.

Wait, maybe it's related to the age of 13? In some East African cultures, 13 is a significant age, like the transition from childhood to adolescence. But I'm not sure if Ethiopia specifically celebrates 13. Alternatively, maybe the age of 30? In some cultures, 30 is considered a milestone.

Alternatively, I've heard about the Ethiopian ""Fira"" or ""Firata"" ceremony, which is a coming-of-age ritual. Let me think. The Fira ceremony is for girls turning 15, where they are considered adults. But is that the most grandly celebrated? Or is there another age?

Wait, I think in Ethiopia, the age of 13 is significant. There's a ceremony called ""Tikur"" or ""Tikur Meskel"" for boys turning 13, where they get their first haircut, symbolizing their transition to manhood. That might be a big event. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the age of 21 is more significant, but I can't recall.

Alternatively, the Ethiopian calendar is 13 months, so maybe that's a factor. But I don't think that's related to birthdays. Another angle: in Ethiopia, the 13th year is considered a significant age, and there's a ritual called ""Tikur"" for boys at 13. If that's the case, then maybe the 13th birthday is celebrated more grandly. However, I need to confirm if this is the most grandly celebrated",1,,,,1,0.5

Jod-ch-07,"How long (in hours) on average does it take for people in Ethiopia to have dinner at a restaurant? (Provide Arabic numerals up to one decimal point (e.g., 2, 3.5) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how long, on average, people in Ethiopia take to have dinner at a restaurant. Let me start by thinking about what factors might influence this.

First, cultural habits. In some cultures, meals are more leisurely, while in others, they might be quicker. Ethiopia has a rich culinary tradition, with dishes like injera and various stews. I wonder if meals there are typically eaten slowly, given the communal aspect of dining, which might involve more conversation and taking time to eat.

Then there's the restaurant setting. Are Ethiopian restaurants usually busy? If so, maybe people don't stay as long because of the pace. But maybe the opposite is true—since meals can be more involved, like eating with hands and taking time to enjoy, people might spend more time. Also, the type of restaurant matters. A casual eatery might have quicker service, while a fine dining place could be longer. But I don't have specific data on that.

Looking for existing data. I don't recall specific studies on average dining times in Ethiopia. Maybe I can infer from similar countries. For example, in some African countries, dinner might be quicker compared to Western countries where people might spend 1-2 hours. However, Ethiopia's dining culture might be different. 

Another angle: meal duration could be influenced by the time of day. If people have dinner later, maybe they spend more time. But I'm not sure. Also, considering that in some places, dinner is a social event, which could extend the time. 

Wait, but the question is about the average time spent at a restaurant for dinner. So, it's not about how long the meal takes to prepare, but the time from when they sit down to when they leave. 

I think in many places, a typical restaurant meal might take around 1 to 2 hours. But I need to be cautious. If there's no specific data, maybe the answer is an educated guess. However, I should check if there are any sources. Since I can't access current data, I might have to rely on general knowledge.

In some cultures, like in Mediterranean countries, meals can be longer. Ethiopia might be similar. However, if the restaurant is in a city versus a rural area, that could vary. But without specific info, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe the average is around 1.5 hours. That's a common average for many places. But I'm not certain. Since the question",1,,,,1,1.0

New-su-24,What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in Ethiopia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian culture and sports. Ethiopia is known for its long-distance running, like marathon runners, but that's more individual. However, the question is about sports that families do together.

Maybe traditional games? I've heard of some African games that are played by families. For example, in some countries, games like ""knuckleball"" or ""gilli danda"" are common, but I'm not sure if those are in Ethiopia. Alternatively, maybe they play soccer, which is popular globally. But is that typically a family activity?

Another angle: Ethiopia has a lot of open spaces, so maybe they play outdoor games. Maybe something like tag, hide and seek, or other simple games. Also, maybe traditional Ethiopian games. I think there's a game called ""Kubba"" but I'm not sure if that's played by families. Wait, Kubba is a board game, so maybe not the most active.

Wait, I should check if there are any specific sports or games that are family-oriented in Ethiopia. Maybe ""Koche"" or ""Guma"" but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they play with balls, like football (soccer), which is very popular. Parents and kids might play football together in local parks or fields. Also, maybe traditional wrestling, but that might be more for adults.

Another possibility is games that use simple materials, like stones or sticks. For example, ""stone throwing"" games or ""stick fighting,"" but those might be more for kids. Alternatively, maybe they play games like ""hopscotch"" or ""jump rope,"" which are common worldwide and could be done by families.

Wait, I should also consider that in some African cultures, there are traditional games passed down. For example, ""Makuta"" is a game from some regions, but I'm not certain about Ethiopia specifically. Alternatively, maybe they play ""Bao,"" which is a traditional board game from East Africa, but again, not sure if it's family-oriented.

Given that, maybe the most common answer is soccer (football) since it's widely played and could be a family activity. But I'm not entirely sure if there are other traditional games. Alternatively, maybe they play games like ""tag"" or ""chase,"" which are universal. However, the user wants specific sports or games.

Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in Ethiopia's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the required subjects for Ethiopia's university entrance exam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopia's education system. Ethiopia has a national exam called the National Entrance Examination for Higher Education, which is used for admission to universities.

From what I remember, the exam typically includes subjects that are part of the secondary education curriculum. The main subjects might be in the areas of mathematics, science, and language. But I should be precise here.

I think the exam is divided into different tracks, such as the general track and the vocational track. For the general track, the required subjects might be English, Mathematics, and a science subject like Physics or Chemistry. There's also a possibility of a religious studies component, but I'm not sure if that's mandatory for all students.

Wait, I should verify if there are specific subjects that are universally required regardless of the track. The Ethiopian education system has a set of core subjects that students study in secondary school, which are likely to be the basis for the entrance exam. These core subjects include English, Mathematics, and a science subject. Additionally, there might be a subject like Social Studies or History, but I'm not certain.

Another point to consider is that the entrance exam might have different components for different universities or programs. For example, medical schools might require additional subjects, but the basic entrance exam might still have a standard set of subjects. However, the question is about the required subjects in the entrance exam in general, not specific to a program.

I should also check if the exam includes a language component. Since English is a primary language of instruction in Ethiopian universities, it's likely that English is a required subject. Mathematics is a common subject in entrance exams worldwide, so that's probably included. For the science part, it could be either Physics, Chemistry, or Biology, but I need to confirm which one is required.

Wait, I found some information before that the entrance exam includes English, Mathematics, and a science subject. However, sometimes there's also a component for Amharic or another national language, but I'm not sure if that's part of the entrance exam or just part of the school curriculum.

Also, considering that Ethiopia uses a 10-year secondary education system, the entrance exam is based on the final year of secondary school. Therefore, the subjects required would be those that are part of the final year's curriculum. The Ethiopian Secondary Education Curriculum includes subjects like English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Social Studies, and",1,,,,1,1.0

New-pe-86,What is the name of the most famous tower in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of the most famous tower in Ethiopia. Hmm, I need to recall or figure out which tower is the most well-known there.

First, I know Ethiopia has several historical and cultural landmarks. The most famous ones I can think of are related to ancient structures or religious sites. There's the Lalibela churches, which are rock-hewn, but those are churches, not towers. Then there's the Simien Mountains, but those are natural landmarks. 

Wait, maybe it's the Adulis? Adulis was an ancient trading port on the Red Sea. I think there were some ruins there, maybe a tower or a structure. But I'm not sure if that's the most famous. Alternatively, there's the Church of St. George in Adigrat, which has some towers, but I don't know if that's the most famous.

Another possibility is the tower in the ancient city of Axum. Axum is known for its obelisks, but maybe there's a tower there? Or perhaps the tower is part of a different structure. Wait, I remember that the most famous tower in Ethiopia is called the ""Tower of David"" or something similar? No, that's in Jerusalem. Maybe I'm mixing up names.

Wait, maybe it's the ""St. Mary's Cathedral"" in Addis Ababa? But that's a cathedral, not a tower. Alternatively, the Ras Dashen, but that's a mountain. 

Hold on, maybe I should check if there's a tower associated with a specific historical event or structure. The most famous tower in Ethiopia might be the ""Ethiopian Tower"" or ""Bahir Dar Tower""? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the tower could be part of a medieval structure. 

Wait, I think I remember that the most famous tower is the ""Tower of the Church of St. Mary of Zion"" in Axum. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the tower is part of the medieval fortress of Gondar. Gondar has several castles, like Fasil Ghebbi, but those are more like palaces or castles with towers. 

Alternatively, maybe the tower is the one at the Church of Saint Michael in Axum. But again, I'm not sure. Wait, I think I read somewhere that the most famous tower is the ""Tower of David"" in Ethiopia, but that might be a confusion with another location.",1,,,,0,0
Th-en-53,What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular extracurricular social event is at schools in Ethiopia. Let me start by recalling what extracurricular activities typically involve. They're activities outside the regular curriculum, like sports, clubs, cultural events, etc.

Ethiopia has a rich cultural heritage, so maybe cultural events are significant. But I should think about common school activities there. Sports are universal, so events like sports days or competitions might be popular. However, I'm not sure if that's the most popular.

Another angle: religious events. Ethiopia is predominantly Christian, with a significant Orthodox population. Maybe religious festivals or events related to that? But are those considered extracurricular? They might be more community or religious than school-specific.

Then there's the possibility of cultural festivals or fairs where students showcase traditional music, dance, and art. These could be social events that bring the school community together. But I need to check if that's the case.

I should also consider if there are any national holidays or events that schools participate in. For example, the Ethiopian New Year, which is called Enkutatash, celebrated in September. Schools might have events around that time. But is that an extracurricular social event?

Wait, maybe school carnivals or fairs are common. Or perhaps debates, drama competitions, or music festivals. But I'm not certain about Ethiopia specifically.

Looking up some information (pretending to do research), I find that in many Ethiopian schools, cultural and religious events are prominent. However, sports events like inter-school competitions or annual sports days might be widely participated in. Alternatively, the ""Ethiopian Cultural Festival"" organized by schools could be a major event.

But I need to confirm the most popular one. Another thought: school graduation ceremonies are significant, but those are formal events, not extracurricular. Maybe student elections or leadership events?

Alternatively, considering the influence of the Orthodox Church, events like the Easter celebrations or other religious holidays might have school-related activities. However, I'm not sure if they are considered social events.

Wait, I remember that in some Ethiopian schools, there's a tradition of ""Kurban"" or other community events, but I'm not certain. Another angle: music and dance competitions are common in schools as part of cultural education, so those might be popular.

But I need to find the most popular one. If I can't find specific data, maybe the safest answer is cultural festivals or sports events.",1,,,,0,0

New-en-41,Who is the most well known and successful entrepreneur in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most well-known and successful entrepreneur in Ethiopia. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall Ethiopian entrepreneurs. There are several notable figures, but who is the most prominent? I remember that Getu Shiferaw is a big name. He's the founder of Ethio Telecom, which is a major telecommunications company in Ethiopia. But wait, Ethio Telecom is actually a state-owned enterprise, so maybe he's not an entrepreneur in the traditional sense. 

Another name that comes to mind is Alemayehu Tewelde. He's the founder of Awash Bank and has been involved in various business ventures. He's definitely a prominent entrepreneur. Then there's Gebremedhin Yohannes, who founded the Ethiopian Airlines and has been involved in other sectors. But Ethiopian Airlines is also a state-owned company, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should check if there are other entrepreneurs. There's also the founder of the Addis Ababa University's business school, but I don't think that's an entrepreneur. 

Another possibility is the founder of the Ethiopian Coffee Exchange, but I'm not sure about the name. Alternatively, there's the CEO of the Ethiopian Electric Utility, but again, that's a state entity.

Hmm, maybe I need to confirm. Getu Shiferaw is often cited as a key figure in Ethiopian business. He started the first private telecommunications company in Ethiopia, which later became part of Ethio Telecom. However, since Ethio Telecom is government-owned, his role might be more as a businessman rather than an entrepreneur in the private sector. 

Alemayehu Tewelde is another key figure. He's been involved in banking and has a significant presence in the Ethiopian business scene. He's also been a political figure, which might contribute to his visibility. 

Alternatively, there's the founder of the Ethiopian Airlines, but again, that's a state-owned company. 

Wait, maybe I should consider the most successful in terms of business ventures. If Getu Shiferaw is associated with the telecom sector, which is crucial for Ethiopia's development, he might be considered the most successful. However, I'm not entirely sure if he's the most well-known. 

Alternatively, maybe there are others like the founder of the Ethiopian Investment Holding Company, but I don't recall the name. 

I think the safest answer here is Getu Shiferaw, given his role in telecommunications, which",1,,,,0,0

Okay, so I need to find out what the most popular traditional dessert in Ethiopia is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian cuisine. I know that Ethiopian food is known for its use of spices and the communal way of eating, with dishes like injera, a sourdough flatbread, and various stews. But desserts?

Hmm, I'm not too familiar with Ethiopian desserts. Maybe I should think about common ingredients in Ethiopian cooking. They use a lot of honey, ghee, and spices like cardamom. I remember hearing about something called ""kolo"" or ""kolo kocho"" which is a type of bread or cake. Wait, maybe that's not a dessert. Or is it?

Another possibility is ""shiro,"" but I think that's more of a stew made from chickpeas. Then there's ""doro wat,"" which is a spicy chicken dish. No, those are main courses. What about sweets? Maybe something with milk or yogurt? I think there's a dessert called ""shiro"" but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe ""injera"" is used for desserts too? No, injera is usually a side for savory dishes.

Wait, I think I've heard of ""kolo"" being a type of sweet bread. Let me check that again. Alternatively, ""dabo"" or ""dabo kocho"" might be a dessert. Or perhaps ""tibs"" but that's a meat dish. Maybe ""kifto,"" but that's also meat.

Alternatively, maybe there's a dessert made from barley or something else. Wait, I think the answer might be ""kolo"" or ""kolo kocho."" But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: in some East African countries, there's a dessert called ""halva,"" but I don't know if that's Ethiopian.

Alternatively, maybe ""milk tea"" or something else. Wait, I should verify. Let me think again. Ethiopian cuisine does have desserts, and one that comes up in some sources is ""kolo,"" which is a type of sweet bread or cake made from barley or wheat, often flavored with spices and sometimes made into small balls. Another possibility is ""shiro"" but I think that's more of a savory dish.

Alternatively, maybe ""injera"" is used in some sweet dishes, but I think that's not the case. Another thought: there's a dessert called ""dabo,"" which is a type of sweet",1,,,,1,0.5
Ni-en-40,What is the most popular Christmas song in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most popular Christmas song in Ethiopia. Let me think about this. First, I know that Ethiopia is a predominantly Christian country, so they likely have their own Christmas traditions. However, I'm not sure about the specific songs they celebrate with.

I remember that in many African countries, Christmas carols are often adapted into local languages. For example, in Ethiopia, they might use Amharic or other regional languages. But which song is the most popular? I'm not certain. Maybe ""Silent Night"" is popular there, but translated into Amharic? Or perhaps there's a traditional Ethiopian Christmas song that's widely recognized.

Wait, I should check if there's any well-known Christmas song specifically associated with Ethiopia. Maybe ""Gursha"" or ""Tizita"" are traditional songs, but are they Christmas songs? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they sing ""O Holy Night"" or ""Joy to the World"" in their local languages. However, without specific information, it's hard to say.

Since I don't have concrete data on the most popular Christmas song in Ethiopia, I should consider that the answer might not be widely documented. In some cases, the most popular could be a translated version of a classic carol. But I need to be cautious not to assume. If I can't find a definitive answer, maybe the best approach is to state that there isn't a widely recognized single song, but perhaps a commonly performed one. However, the user is asking for the most popular, so I need to provide an answer even if it's an educated guess.

Alternatively, maybe ""Ethiopian Christmas Carol"" is a term used, but I don't know the exact title. Given the lack of information, the safest answer might be that there isn't a single most popular song, but traditional carols are sung. However, the user wants a specific answer in a list. Maybe the answer is that there's no single most popular song, but I have to provide one. Alternatively, perhaps ""Gursha"" is a Christmas song. Wait, ""Gursha"" is actually a traditional Ethiopian song, but I'm not sure if it's specifically for Christmas. Maybe I should confirm that. If I can't confirm, I should state that there's no widely known specific song, but the answer might be that ""Gursha"" is considered a Christmas song in some contexts. However, I'm not entirely sure.

Na-ko-20,What sports event do people from Ethiopia passionately support the most in international competitions?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking which sports event Ethiopians support the most in international competitions. I need to figure out the answer based on what I know.

First, Ethiopia is known for its athletes in long-distance running. They have a lot of success in events like marathons, 10,000 meters, and 5,000 meters. Athletes like Haile Gebrselassie and Derartu Tulu come to mind. So maybe track and field events, specifically long-distance running, are the ones they support the most.

But wait, the question is about the sports event, not the sport itself. So maybe specific events like the Olympics or the World Championships? But the answer might be more specific. For example, the Berlin Marathon is a big event, but is that considered an international competition? Or perhaps the Olympics, where Ethiopia has strong representation in track events.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Olympics, but I think the focus is on the specific events within the Olympics. However, the user might be looking for the sport category. But the question says ""sports event,"" which could be a bit ambiguous. However, in Ethiopia, the support is mainly for long-distance running events in track and field. So maybe the answer is track and field events, but the most specific event could be the marathon or the 10,000 meters. But the question is about the event they support the most, so perhaps the marathon? Or maybe the Olympics as a whole?

Wait, I think in Ethiopia, they have a strong cultural connection to long-distance running. So the main events they support would be the long-distance track events in international competitions like the Olympics or World Championships. However, the answer might be more general. Maybe the answer is ""long-distance running events"" or ""track and field events."" But the answer needs to be specific. Alternatively, the main international event they support is the Olympics, but the actual events within that are the long-distance races. However, the question asks for the sports event, which could be the marathon or other specific events. But I think the answer is more likely to be track and field events, specifically long-distance running. But I need to check if there's a specific event. However, I think the answer is track and field events, particularly long-distance running, so maybe the answer is ""track and field events"" or ""long-distance running events.""

Al-en-04,What is the most popular fruit in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular fruit in Ethiopia is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian cuisine and agriculture. Ethiopia is known for its diverse range of crops, but when it comes to fruits, I'm not entirely sure. I know that they have a lot of coffee, but that's a bean, not a fruit. Maybe mangoes? I've heard that mangoes are grown there. Also, there's the indigenous fruit called the ""khat,"" but wait, khat is a stimulant plant, not a fruit. Maybe I should check common fruits in the region.

Ethiopia's climate varies, so different regions might have different popular fruits. In the highlands, maybe apples or other temperate fruits? But I'm not sure if they are the most popular. I think the most commonly consumed fruits might be those that are widely available and used in traditional dishes. For example, the ""sode"" or ""soddo"" is a type of fruit, but I'm not certain. Another possibility is the ""injera"" is a flatbread, not a fruit. Wait, maybe the answer is mango. I've seen sources mention that mango is one of the most popular fruits in Ethiopia, often used in dishes and consumed fresh. Also, bananas are grown there, but are they more popular? Or maybe the ""kundah"" fruit? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I can think about exports. Ethiopia exports certain fruits. If I remember correctly, they export coffee, but also fruits like avocados and mangoes. However, popularity might not directly correlate with exports. Another angle: traditional Ethiopian desserts or dishes. I know that they have a fruit called ""kolo"" which is a type of fruit, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up common fruits in Ethiopia. Wait, I can't access external sources, so I need to rely on existing knowledge.

I think the most commonly cited fruit in Ethiopia is the mango. It's widely grown and consumed. Another possibility is the ""bale"" mango, which is a local variety. Alternatively, the ""mangosteen"" is a tropical fruit, but I don't think it's as common. Also, there's the ""lemon"" or ""lime"" used in cooking, but again, not sure if it's the most popular. Considering all this, I think the answer is mango, but I need to be cautious. Maybe the answer is the",1,,,,1,0.5
New-gr-06,What is the most popular food in Ethiopia among young people?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular food in Ethiopia is among young people. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian cuisine. Traditional dishes include injera, which is a sourdough flatbread, and various stews like doro wat (spicy chicken stew) or shiro (chickpea stew). These are often eaten with injera, using hands to tear pieces and scoop up the stew.

But the question is about young people specifically. Maybe there's a shift in preferences? I know that in many countries, younger generations might be influenced by global trends, so perhaps fast food or fusion dishes are more popular. However, Ethiopia has a strong cultural attachment to its traditional foods. Injera is a staple, so maybe it's still popular even among the youth. But I should check if there's a specific dish that's trending now.

I also remember that Ethiopian food is often eaten communally, which might be more traditional. Young people might still prefer traditional dishes but maybe with some modern twists. However, I'm not sure if there's a single dish that's most popular. Alternatively, maybe street food is more common among young people. For example, items like shiro, which is a thick stew, or maybe even something like kibbeh or other street snacks. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I've heard that injera is the base for most meals, so even if the stew varies, injera itself is a common element. But the question asks for the most popular food, which might refer to a complete dish. Alternatively, maybe the combination of injera with a particular stew is considered the main dish. However, the answer might be that injera is the most popular, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Another possibility is that younger people are more into fast food chains or international cuisines, but that might not be the case in Ethiopia. 

I should verify if there's any recent data or surveys about Ethiopian youth food preferences. Since I don't have access to current data, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. In many African countries, traditional foods remain popular despite globalization. So, it's possible that injera-based dishes are still the most popular. However, the question might be looking for a specific dish. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no single most popular food, but the question requires a list, so likely a specific answer. 

Another angle: Ethiopian restaurants often serve dishes like doro wat",1,,,,1,1.0

Ji-ko-26,What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Ethiopia's society?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the key milestones for children's independence from their parents in Ethiopian society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian culture and societal norms.

First, I need to think about traditional practices in Ethiopia. In many African cultures, children often live with their parents until they get married. So maybe marriage is a big milestone. Then, when they get married, they might move out, but I should check if that's still the case.

Also, education plays a role. In Ethiopia, the education system is structured, and completing secondary education might be a step towards independence. But does that mean they leave home? Maybe not necessarily, but it's a step towards self-sufficiency.

Another aspect is employment. Starting a job or being able to support oneself could be a milestone. But in some cases, even after getting a job, they might still live at home until marriage.

Religious and cultural practices might influence this. For example, in Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, certain rites of passage could be significant. Maybe the age of majority? In Ethiopia, the legal age of majority is 18, so that could be a point where they are considered adults, though they might still depend on parents financially.

Also, the role of the extended family is important in Ethiopia. So maybe milestones are not just about leaving home but taking on responsibilities within the family or community. However, the question specifically mentions independence from parents, so perhaps focusing on when they start living separately.

Wait, I should make sure I'm not conflating general African practices with Ethiopian specifics. Let me think again. In Ethiopia, it's common for children to live with their parents until marriage. Once married, especially if they get married through arranged marriages, they might move to their spouse's family home, but that's a different dynamic. However, the act of marriage itself is a key milestone where they start their own household.

Another point could be completing higher education, which might lead to moving out. Also, in urban areas, there might be more independence earlier compared to rural areas. But the user is asking about Ethiopian society in general, not regional differences.

So compiling this, the key milestones would be: reaching the age of majority (18), completing secondary education, getting married, starting employment, and possibly starting a family. However, some of these might overlap or be in sequence. Marriage is likely the most significant as it's a cultural norm that marks independence from the parents.

I need to ensure that each milestone is distinct and",1,,,,1,1.0

Th-en-37,"At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Ethiopia? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out at what age children typically become independent from their parents in Ethiopia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopia's culture and societal norms.

Ethiopia is a country in East Africa with a rich cultural heritage. Traditional family structures there often emphasize strong family ties and intergenerational support. In many African cultures, children might stay with their parents longer than in Western societies. However, I'm not entirely sure about the specific age in Ethiopia.

I remember that in some parts of Africa, it's common for children to stay with their parents until they get married or start a family themselves. But I should check if there's a general age when they might move out. Also, factors like economic conditions, education, and urban vs. rural differences might influence this. For example, in urban areas, maybe children might leave earlier due to better job opportunities, while in rural areas, they might stay longer to help with farming or other family duties.

I should consider if there are any cultural practices or rites of passage that indicate independence. In some cultures, a certain age is associated with maturity or responsibility. However, Ethiopia's practices might vary by region and ethnic group. The Oromo, Amhara, Tigray, and other ethnic groups might have different norms.

Looking up some sources, but since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on existing knowledge. I think in many traditional Ethiopian settings, children might not move out until they are married, which could be around late teens to early twenties. However, in modern times, with increased education and urbanization, some might leave earlier, perhaps around 18-20 years old. But the question asks for the typical age, so maybe the traditional norm is considered here.

Another angle: in some African countries, the age of majority is 18, but that doesn't necessarily mean independence. It might be more about legal adulthood rather than living independently. So maybe the answer is around 18-20, but I'm not certain. However, I need to provide a specific number. If I recall, some sources mention that in Ethiopia, children often stay with their parents until marriage, which can be in the late teens or early twenties. But if we have to give a single number, maybe 18 is the age when they are considered adults, but actual independence might be later. Alternatively, maybe around 20-25.

Al-en-01,What is a common snack for preschool kids in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out a common snack for preschool kids in Ethiopia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian cuisine and typical foods. Ethiopia has a lot of traditional dishes like injera, which is a flatbread, and various stews. But those are more for main meals. For snacks, especially for kids, maybe something that's easy to eat and portable.

I remember that in many African countries, snacks can include things like fruits, nuts, or small pastries. In Ethiopia, there's a snack called ""kolo"" which is a type of bread, but I'm not sure if that's common for kids. Another possibility is ""dabo,"" which is a type of flatbread, but again, not sure about its popularity as a snack for preschoolers.

Wait, maybe it's something like ""shiro,"" but that's a type of stew. Maybe they have something sweet? There's ""kolo"" and ""beyayej"" which is a type of bread served with coffee, but again, not sure if that's a snack for kids. Another thought: in Ethiopia, they might have traditional snacks like ""sambusa,"" which are fried pastries filled with spiced meat or vegetables. But would that be common for preschoolers? Maybe not, as it's more of a savory snack.

Alternatively, maybe they have simple snacks like fruits such as mangoes, bananas, or avocados, which are common in Ethiopia. But the question asks for a common snack, so perhaps a specific food item. I think ""kolo"" might be more of a snack, but I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is ""chif chif,"" which is a type of spiced bread, but again, not sure if it's a preschool snack.

Wait, I should check if there's any commonly recognized snack for children in Ethiopia. Maybe ""injera"" with a small amount of spiced meat or vegetables, but that's more of a meal. Alternatively, maybe they have small portions of ""doro wat"" (spicy chicken stew), but that seems too heavy for a snack.

Alternatively, maybe it's a sweet snack like ""kolo"" with honey or something. But perhaps the answer is ""injera"" as a snack, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe ""tibs,"" which is a stir-fry of meat, but again, not sure.

An-ar-03,Which month is the final exam term usually scheduled at high schools in Ethiopia? (Provide Arabic numerals (1~12) only.),"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the month when final exams are usually scheduled in high schools in Ethiopia. They want the answer in Arabic numerals from 1 to 12, and the response should be in JSON format with a list.

First, I need to recall or find out the typical academic calendar in Ethiopia. Ethiopia's academic year might be structured differently from Western countries. I remember that in many countries, final exams are at the end of the academic year, which is often around June or July. But Ethiopia's school terms might be split into different semesters or terms.

Wait, Ethiopia's school year usually starts in September or October. So if the school year starts in September, the final exams might be at the end of the year, which would be around June or July. But I need to confirm this. Let me think. In some regions, the academic year might be divided into two terms: the first term ending in February or March, and the second term ending in June or July. So the final exams might be in June or July, which would be months 6 or 7.

Alternatively, maybe the school year runs from September to June, with exams in June. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in Ethiopia, the traditional school calendar might be split into two terms. For example, the first term from September to January, and the second term from February to June. Then the final exams would be in June (month 6) or July (month 7). However, I need to check if there's a standard answer here.

Wait, some sources indicate that in Ethiopia, the academic year for high schools typically ends in June. So the final exams would be in June. But I should make sure. If the school year starts in September, then the final exams would be in June, which is month 6. Alternatively, if the school year is split into two terms with exams at the end of each term, but the final term might be in June. 

Another thought: some countries have their final exams in July. But I need to be precise. Maybe the answer is June (6) or July (7). But without exact data, I need to rely on common knowledge. Given that Ethiopia's academic calendar is often aligned with the Northern Hemisphere, but with some variations. For example, in some cases, the school year might start in September and end in June. So the final exams would be in June, which is month 6.",1,,,,0,0

Kik-in-16,What drink is commonly consumed in Ethiopia when the weather is cold?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking what drink is commonly consumed in Ethiopia when the weather is cold. I need to figure this out.

First, I know Ethiopia is a country in East Africa. The climate there varies, but I think the highlands have cooler temperatures, especially at higher altitudes. So during colder weather, people might have specific drinks to warm up.

Ethiopian coffee is famous, but I'm not sure if that's specifically for cold weather. Maybe they have something else. I've heard of a drink called ""Tej,"" which is a traditional honey wine. But is that consumed more during cold weather?

Wait, maybe it's ""Berebere,"" but that's a spice blend. No, that's not a drink. Another thought: in colder weather, people might prefer hot beverages. So perhaps something like coffee or tea. But the question is about a specific drink commonly consumed when it's cold.

I think in Ethiopia, when it's cold, people might drink ""Tej"" or ""Tella,"" which are traditional fermented drinks. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's ""Injera"" with some sauce, but that's food, not a drink.

Wait, I should check. Tej is a type of honey wine, which is a bit sweet and alcoholic. It's made from fermented honey and is a traditional drink. However, I'm not certain if it's specifically for cold weather. Alternatively, maybe it's a type of tea or coffee.

Another angle: in many cultures, hot drinks are consumed in cold weather. Ethiopia has a strong coffee culture, so perhaps coffee is the answer. But the question is about a specific drink that's commonly consumed during cold weather. Maybe ""Ethiopian coffee"" is the answer, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific drink like ""Shiro"" or something else. Wait, no, Shiro is a type of porridge. Let me think again. I've heard that in some parts of Ethiopia, during colder months, people might drink a spiced tea or a type of beer. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe ""Tella"" is the answer. Tella is a traditional Ethiopian homebrewed beer made from barley. It's a type of low-alcohol beer. So perhaps during cold weather, people drink Tella. But I'm not 100% sure. However, considering that in colder weather,",1,,,,1,0.6666666666666666
Al-en-39,What do people eat on their birthday in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people eat on their birthday in Ethiopia. Let me start by recalling any information I have about Ethiopian cuisine and traditions. Ethiopian food is known for its use of spices, injera (a type of flatbread), and various stews. But I'm not sure if there are specific dishes reserved for birthdays.

First, I should check if there are any traditional dishes that are commonly eaten on birthdays. I know that in many African cultures, certain foods are associated with celebrations. For example, in some places, they might have a special cake or a particular stew. However, Ethiopia's cuisine is quite diverse, with different regional dishes.

Injera is a staple food, so maybe it's part of birthday meals. Doro wat, which is a spicy chicken stew, is a popular dish. Maybe that's served on special occasions. Also, there's a dish called shiro, which is a chickpea or lentil stew. But are these specifically for birthdays?

I should also consider if there are any celebratory foods unique to birthdays. Sometimes, people might have a cake, but I don't know if that's common in Ethiopia. Alternatively, they might have a special type of bread or a sweet dish. I'm not sure about birthday cakes being traditional there. Maybe they use local ingredients to make a cake, but I need to confirm.

Another angle: perhaps the main meal is similar to other celebrations, so they might have a combination of dishes. Since Ethiopian meals are often communal, served on a platter with injera, the birthday meal would likely include a variety of stews and side dishes. But I need to specify which dishes are typically eaten on birthdays.

I should also think about any cultural practices. In some Ethiopian traditions, the birthday might be celebrated with family gatherings, and the food would be the same as any other festive occasion. So maybe they eat their traditional dishes, but not necessarily anything specific to birthdays. However, the user is asking for what they eat on their birthday, so there might be some common dishes.

Wait, I remember that in some parts of Ethiopia, people might eat a special type of bread called ""dabo"" or ""kolo"" on birthdays, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they have a sweet called ""shiro"" or another dessert. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the meal being a special feast with traditional dishes rather than specific birthday foods.

Since I can't recall specific birthday foods, perhaps the answer is that",1,,,,1,1.0
Ne-ar-26,What is the most famous public corporation in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most famous public corporation in Ethiopia is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopia's economy and major companies.

Ethiopia is a country in the Horn of Africa, and its economy has been growing, though it's still developing. Public corporations there might be state-owned enterprises. I remember that in many countries, the most prominent state-owned companies are in sectors like telecommunications, banking, or energy.

I think Ethiopia has a state-owned telecom company. Maybe Ethio Telecom? That name sounds familiar. Ethio Telecom is often mentioned in the context of providing internet and mobile services in Ethiopia. Since telecommunications is a critical sector, especially in a country where internet access is expanding, Ethio Telecom could be a major player.

Are there other significant public corporations? There's the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, which handles electricity generation and distribution. But I'm not sure if that's as well-known as Ethio Telecom. Also, there might be banks like the Development Bank of Ethiopia, but again, not sure about their fame compared to telecom.

Another angle: sometimes the largest companies by revenue or market share are considered the most famous. If Ethio Telecom is the main provider, it might have a large customer base and thus be more prominent. Also, in media and news, Ethio Telecom might be referenced more often, especially regarding internet regulations or services.

I should verify if there's any other major public corporation. Maybe the Ethiopian Airlines? Wait, Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline, but is it a public corporation? I think it's a state-owned enterprise, but maybe it's more recognized internationally. However, the question specifies ""public corporation,"" which might refer to a company that is publicly traded or state-owned. Ethiopian Airlines is state-owned, so it's a possibility. But which one is more famous?

Ethio Telecom is probably more prominent in terms of daily services for the general population. Ethiopian Airlines is a major international carrier, but perhaps not as ""public"" in the sense of everyday services. However, the question's phrasing might depend on how ""famous"" is defined. If it's about global recognition, Ethiopian Airlines might be more famous, but if it's about domestic presence and essential services, Ethio Telecom.

Wait, I need to check if Ethiopian Airlines is considered a public corporation. Public corporations can be either publicly traded or state-owned. Ethiopian Airlines is a state-owned enterprise, so it's a public corporation. However, Ethio Telecom is also state",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ch-07,What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what food items people in Ethiopia typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian cuisine and drinking habits.

Ethiopian food is known for its rich spices and variety of dishes, like injera (a sourdough flatbread), doro wat (spicy chicken stew), and various vegetable and meat dishes. Now, when it comes to pairing with hard liquor, which in Ethiopia might include things like tequila, vodka, or local spirits, I need to think about common combinations.

I remember that in many cultures, hard liquor is paired with salty or spicy foods to balance the flavors. Ethiopian dishes are often spicy, so maybe they pair with something that can cut through the spice. Also, there's a tradition of drinking beer with meals, but the question is about hard liquor.

I think in Ethiopia, when people drink harder liquors, they might go for snacks that are simple but complement the strong flavors. Things like popcorn, nuts, or maybe some fried snacks. Also, there's a local drink called tej, which is a honey wine, but that's not a hard liquor. 

Wait, maybe they use traditional snacks like kolo (a type of porridge) or shiro (chickpea stew) as accompaniments? Or perhaps they have specific appetizers. Another angle: in some regions, people might pair spirits with cheese or dried fruits, but I'm not sure if that's common in Ethiopia.

I should also consider if there are any specific dishes or snacks that are commonly served with hard liquor in social settings. Maybe something like injera with spicy sauce, but that's more of a main dish. Alternatively, maybe they serve small bites like fried plantains or other starchy sides.

I need to make sure I'm not mixing up Ethiopian pairings with other cultures. For example, in some countries, they might have specific appetizers for spirits. But Ethiopia's traditional pairings might be more about the local snacks that are easy to eat with alcohol.

Another thought: in Ethiopia, during social gatherings, people might have a variety of small dishes. So, perhaps items like boiled eggs, pickles, or spicy sauces. But I'm not entirely certain. Since I don't have specific information, I should consider that the answer might be general, like snacks that are commonly available and pair well with strong flavors.

In the end, the safest answer, based on common practices where spicy or strong foods are paired with something that can",1,,,,1,1.0

New-as-20,What is the most popular indoor sport in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Ethiopia is. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is known for its long-distance running athletes, like Haile Gebrselassie and Derartu Tulu. But that's outdoor track and field, right? The question is about an indoor sport.

Indoor sports would be things like basketball, volleyball, table tennis, or maybe even indoor soccer. But I'm not sure which is most popular in Ethiopia. I remember that Ethiopia has a strong tradition in athletics, but that's outdoors. Maybe they have indoor versions of those sports?

Wait, maybe I should think about the infrastructure. Ethiopia might have more stadiums for track and field, but indoor facilities could be limited. However, sports like table tennis or badminton might be popular in indoor settings. Alternatively, maybe volleyball is played in gyms. But I'm not certain.

I should also consider cultural factors. Are there any sports that are widely followed in TV or local communities indoors? Maybe football (soccer) is popular, but that's typically played outdoors. However, there might be indoor football variants. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Ethiopia.

Another angle: looking at international competitions. Ethiopia's athletes are known in track and field, but for indoor sports, maybe they have a strong presence in something else. Wait, maybe the answer is table tennis. I think Ethiopia has had some table tennis players, but is that the most popular?

Alternatively, maybe volleyball. But I'm not sure. I might be confusing with other African countries. Let me try to think if there's any data or common knowledge about this. If I can't find specific info, maybe the answer is that there's no widely recognized indoor sport, but given the context, the user expects an answer.

Wait, maybe the most popular indoor sport in Ethiopia is actually athletics, but that's usually outdoors. However, there might be indoor track events. But I think the primary answer they're looking for is table tennis or maybe volleyball. Alternatively, maybe it's not a team sport but something else.

Alternatively, considering that many indoor sports are played in gyms or community centers, perhaps something like weightlifting or boxing. But again, not sure. Maybe the answer is that the most popular is athletics, but since that's typically outdoor, perhaps the user is looking for an indoor variant.

Okay, so the user is asking which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Ethiopia. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee, so there's a strong coffee culture there. But when it comes to specific coffee shop brands, I'm not entirely sure. I remember that in many countries, there are local chains that dominate, but maybe in Ethiopia, it's different.

Wait, I think there's a chain called ""Birr Coffee"" or something similar. Or maybe ""Café de Moka""? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a local chain that's not as well-known internationally. Another possibility is that the most popular might be a franchise like Starbucks, but I doubt that's the case in Ethiopia. Maybe the answer is that there isn't a single dominant brand, but the user is asking for the most popular one.

I should verify this. Let me recall. Ethiopia has a lot of small, local coffee shops, but maybe there's a chain that's more established. I think ""Café de Moka"" is a well-known Ethiopian coffee brand, but I'm not sure if it's a shop or just a product. Alternatively, ""Ethiopian Coffee Company"" might be a possibility, but again, not sure.

Wait, I think the answer might be that there isn't a single most popular coffee shop brand, but the user is expecting a specific answer. Alternatively, maybe ""Birr"" is the answer. Hmm. I'm not 100% certain. Let me check my knowledge again. 

Ethiopia's coffee culture is deeply rooted, but in terms of branded coffee shops, I believe that there are several local chains, but none are as dominant as Starbucks in other countries. Maybe the answer is that there's no single most popular brand, but the user might be expecting a specific name. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the most popular is a local chain like ""Café de Moka"" or ""Ethiopian Coffee Company.""

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific chain that I'm not aware of. If I can't be certain, maybe the safest answer is that there isn't a single most popular brand, but given the question's requirement for an answer, I might have to go with the most commonly cited one. I'll go with ""Café de Moka"" as the most popular, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the",1,,,,0,0
New-gr-58,Which job is considered underpaid in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking which job is considered underpaid in Ethiopia. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall information about the Ethiopian job market. Ethiopia has a growing economy, but there are still sectors where wages might be low. Common jobs that are often mentioned in discussions about underpayment in developing countries include roles in agriculture, domestic work, and certain service sectors.

Agriculture is a major part of Ethiopia's economy, employing a large portion of the population. However, farm workers might not earn much, especially in rural areas. But I should check if there's a more specific role within that sector.

Another possibility is teaching, especially in public schools. Teachers might not receive adequate salaries, leading to underpayment. However, I'm not entirely sure if that's the most commonly cited underpaid job.

Domestic workers, like housekeepers or nannies, might be underpaid as well. In many countries, domestic workers are in low-wage positions, and Ethiopia might be similar. However, I need to confirm if this is a recognized issue there.

Also, healthcare workers, especially in rural areas, might be underpaid, but I'm not certain. Maybe the most common answer is a specific role like a teacher or a farmer. Wait, I think I've seen reports where teachers in Ethiopia are mentioned as being underpaid. But I should be careful not to assume without evidence.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different profession. Let me think again. In some contexts, government jobs might have low salaries, but that's not always the case. Or maybe jobs in the informal sector, like street vendors, but those are more about lack of job security than underpayment.

Wait, the user wants a single answer in a list. So I need to pick the most commonly recognized underpaid job in Ethiopia. From what I remember, teaching in public schools is often cited. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific role like a ""teacher"" or ""farmer."" However, I should verify.

Alternatively, I might have read that in Ethiopia, the job of a ""teacher"" is considered underpaid. But I need to be cautious. If I'm not certain, maybe I should go with the most common answer, even if I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is ""teacher"" or ""agricultural worker."" But the user wants only one answer. Let me check if there's a consensus on this.

New-en-47,What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Ethiopia. I need to think about Ethiopian culture and common practices there.

First, I remember that in many African countries, backyards often have plants for food or medicinal use. Ethiopia has a rich tradition of using herbs and plants. Maybe they grow spices like berbere or other local herbs. Also, there's the practice of keeping animals, but that might be more in rural areas. Wait, the question is about back gardens, so maybe not livestock. 

Another thought: in some regions, people might have small vegetable gardens. Ethiopia has a variety of crops like teff, which is a staple grain. But would that be in a back garden? Maybe. Also, there's a tradition of using plants for shade or ornamental purposes. Maybe trees like acacia or other native species. 

Wait, I've heard that in Ethiopian homes, especially in urban areas, people might have small gardens with herbs and vegetables. Also, there's the use of plants for traditional medicine. So perhaps a mix of edible plants, herbs, and maybe some trees. 

I should verify if there's a specific plant commonly found. For example, the enset plant is important in some regions, but that might be more in the fields. Alternatively, coffee plants? But coffee is usually grown in plantations. 

Hmm. Maybe the answer is that they have herbs and vegetables for household use. Or perhaps a specific plant like the ""khat"" plant, but I think khat is more associated with chewing and might not be in gardens. 

Wait, I think the common answer here is that back gardens in Ethiopia often have a variety of herbs and vegetables, such as amaranth, okra, or other local greens. Also, maybe some fruit trees. But I need to be precise. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that they have a garden with plants used for traditional medicine and food. 

Another angle: in Ethiopian homes, especially in urban settings, people might have small gardens with plants like basil, mint, or other herbs. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is that they typically have a garden with herbs and vegetables, but I need to confirm if there's a specific common element. 

Alternatively, maybe the use of plants for religious or cultural purposes, but that might be less common in a typical backyard. 

I think the safest answer is that they have a garden with herbs and vegetables",1,,,,1,1.0
New-en-05,Which food is a cost-effective and quick meal option in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about a cost-effective and quick meal option in Ethiopia. Let me think about Ethiopian cuisine. They have a lot of dishes, but which ones are both affordable and fast?

First, I know that injera is a staple. It's a type of flatbread made from teff flour. But injera alone isn't a complete meal. However, when it's served with various stews or dishes, it becomes a full meal. But maybe the question is about a single dish that's quick to prepare.

Wait, there's a dish called ""Shiro,"" which is a chickpea or broad bean flour stew. It's commonly eaten with injera. But is it quick? Maybe not the quickest because it requires cooking the stew.

Another option is ""Doro Wat,"" which is a spicy chicken stew. But that might take longer to prepare and might be more expensive because of the chicken.

What about ""Kitfo""? That's a raw minced beef dish, usually served with injera. But preparing it might not be quick, and it's more of a special dish.

Then there's ""Tibs,"" which is sautéed meat, often with vegetables. It's cooked quickly and is a common dish. But again, it might require some time and ingredients.

Wait, maybe ""Shiro"" is more cost-effective because it uses legumes, which are cheaper. But how about ""Injera with lentil stew""? Lentils are affordable and can be cooked quickly.

Alternatively, ""Ful"" is a dish made from fava beans, common in Ethiopia. It's usually served with bread or injera. But is it quick? The beans need to be cooked, so maybe not the fastest.

Wait, maybe the answer is ""Injera with Shiro"" because it's a combination that's both affordable and can be prepared relatively quickly. Injera is a staple, and Shiro is made from legumes, which are cheap and can be cooked in a pot.

But the user wants a single answer. Maybe the most common and quick option is ""Injera with lentil or shiro stew."" But I need to confirm if there's a specific dish known for being quick and cost-effective.

Alternatively, ""Shiro"" alone might be considered, but it's usually eaten with injera. However, if the question allows for a combination, then that's the answer. But maybe the user is looking for a single dish that's quick. However,",1,,,,1,1.0

Ji-ko-25,What are the family-related holidays in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the family-related holidays in Ethiopia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian holidays. Ethiopia has a lot of religious holidays, mainly Christian ones since the majority are Orthodox Christians. But the question is about family-related holidays, so maybe some of those religious days are also family-oriented.

First, I remember that the Ethiopian calendar is a bit different from the Gregorian one. For example, the start of the year is called Enkutatash, which is on September 11th in the Gregorian calendar. That's a big celebration, so maybe that's a family holiday because people gather to celebrate the new year with family.

Then there's the Feast of the Entry of the Queen of Sheba, which is called the ""Entry of the Queen of Sheba"" or ""The Entry of the Ark of the Covenant."" I think this is a major holiday, and it's celebrated on November 24th. It's a religious holiday, but families might gather for church services and then have family events.

Another one is the Ethiopian Christmas, which is called Ganna. It's on January 7th in the Gregorian calendar. That's definitely a time for family gatherings, similar to Christmas elsewhere, so that's probably a family holiday.

There's also the Feast of the Cross, which is called ""Meskel"" in Amharic. It's celebrated on September 25th. This is a significant religious holiday where people go to the church, and there's a ceremony with a cross. Families might attend services and then have family time together.

I should check if there are other holidays. Maybe the New Year, which I mentioned earlier, Enkutatash. Also, there's the celebration of the Virgin Mary, like the Feast of the Assumption on August 15th. That might be a time for family gatherings as well.

Wait, but I need to confirm if these are actually considered family-related. Some holidays might be more religious than family-oriented. But in many cultures, religious holidays do involve family activities. So maybe all these are considered family-related in Ethiopia.

Let me list them out again:

1. Enkutatash (Ethiopian New Year) - September 11
2. Meskel (Feast of the Cross) - September 25
3. Genna (Ethiopian Christmas) - January 7
4. The Entry of the Queen of Sheba - November 24",1,,,,,
Sa-en-7,What are popular snacks in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the popular snacks in Ethiopia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian cuisine. Ethiopia is known for its rich and diverse food culture, with a lot of vegetarian options because of religious influences. They have dishes like injera, which is a type of flatbread, and various stews like doro wat. But the question is about snacks, not main meals.

Snacks might include things that are commonly eaten between meals or as street food. I remember hearing about items like shiro, which is a chickpea flour soup, but I'm not sure if that's a snack. Then there's kitcha, which is a type of porridge made from barley or wheat. Maybe that's more of a breakfast item, though.

Another thing I think about is the use of spices like berbere, which is a blend of chili peppers and other spices. Maybe there are snacks that are spiced with that. Also, there's a snack called ""dabo"" which is a type of flatbread, but I'm not certain. 

I should check if there are specific street foods or common household snacks. In many countries, things like popcorn, nuts, or fried snacks are popular. Maybe Ethiopia has similar items. There's also ""chif chif,"" which is a type of rolled flatbread that's sometimes sold by street vendors. 

Another possibility is ""tibs,"" which is a stir-fry of meat or vegetables, but that might be more of a main dish. Then there's ""shiro,"" which I mentioned earlier. Maybe ""injera"" is used as a wrap for snacks. 

Wait, I think there's a snack called ""tella"" which is a type of beer, but that's an alcoholic drink, not a snack. Also, ""kolo"" is a type of bread, but again, not sure if it's a snack. 

I should also consider that some Ethiopian snacks might be similar to other East African snacks. For example, ""samosas"" are popular in many regions, but I don't know if they're common in Ethiopia. 

Another thought: ""Doro wat"" is a spicy chicken stew, but again, that's a main dish. Maybe ""misir wat"" (spiced lentils) is eaten as a snack. 

Wait, I think ""injera"" is often used as a base for various dishes, but as a snack, maybe it's served with spiced butter or",1,,,,0,0
Ta-pe-29,Which professional sport is the highest paying in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking which professional sport is the highest paying in Ethiopia. Let me think about this.

First, I need to consider the sports that are popular in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is well-known for long-distance running, especially in events like marathons and track and field. Athletes like Derartu Tulu and Kenenisa Bekele have gained international fame. However, are these athletes part of a professional league or do they compete individually? In many cases, Ethiopian runners compete in international events, but they might not be part of a structured professional league within Ethiopia itself.

Next, I should check if there are other sports with professional leagues in Ethiopia. Football (soccer) is a popular sport globally and in many countries, but I'm not sure if there's a well-established professional league in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Premier League exists, but I don't know the salaries of the players there. Similarly, basketball or other sports might have lower visibility and fewer professional opportunities.

Another angle: sponsorship and prize money. Ethiopian runners often receive sponsorships from international brands, which could make their income higher compared to local leagues. However, if the question is about professional sports within Ethiopia's own leagues, then maybe football or another sport might be the answer. But I'm not certain about the income levels in those leagues.

Wait, the question is about the highest paying professional sport in Ethiopia. If the professional structure is more international for runners, but within Ethiopia's own professional leagues, perhaps football is the main one. However, without specific data on salaries in Ethiopian sports leagues, it's hard to say. But given Ethiopia's prominence in distance running, even if those athletes are not part of a local league, their earnings might be higher. However, if the question refers to professional sports that are organized within Ethiopia, then the answer might differ.

I need to verify if there's a professional league in Ethiopia for any sport. The Ethiopian Premier League is a professional football league, but I don't know if it's the highest paying. Alternatively, maybe sports like boxing or others have higher earnings. But without concrete data, it's challenging. Since I can't access current data, I have to rely on general knowledge.

Given that Ethiopian athletes in long-distance running can earn significant amounts through international competitions and sponsorships, even if they're not part of a local league, they might be the highest paid. However, if the question is strictly about professional leagues within Ethiopia, then maybe football. But the answer might be that there's no",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ch-38,Which cities or regions are known for their import and export activities in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which cities or regions in Ethiopia are known for their import and export activities. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopia's economy and trade.

Ethiopia is a landlocked country in the Horn of Africa. Its economy relies heavily on agriculture, but trade is also significant. Since it's landlocked, its ports are in neighboring countries, like Djibouti. I remember that Addis Ababa is the capital and the largest city, so it's probably a major center for trade. But are there other cities?

I think the port of Djibouti is crucial for Ethiopia's exports and imports because it's the main gateway. But Djibouti is a separate country, so maybe the region around the border, like Dire Dawa? Dire Dawa is a city in Ethiopia near the Djibouti border, so it might be a key logistics hub. 

Also, there's the Awash River basin, which is an important area for trade routes. Maybe the Oromia Region? It's the largest region and has major cities like Bishoftu and Nazareth, which might be involved in trade.

Another point: the Ethiopian government has been developing infrastructure, like the Ethio-Djibouti Railway, which connects Addis Ababa to Djibouti. That would make Addis Ababa and Djibouti (though it's a different country) important for trade. But since the question is about Ethiopian cities or regions, Djibouti itself isn't part of Ethiopia, but maybe the area near the border.

I've also heard of the city of Harar, which is in the eastern part of Ethiopia. It's known for trade with neighboring countries like Somalia and Sudan, so that might be another region involved in exports and imports.

Then there's the Gambela Region, which is near the Sudanese border. It might have trade activities with Sudan. Also, the Benishangul-Gumuz Region borders Sudan and South Sudan, so that could be another area for cross-border trade.

But I need to be careful not to include regions that aren't primarily known for trade. The main cities are probably Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and maybe Harar. The regions might include Oromia, Dire Dawa (which is a city in the Oromia Region?), or maybe the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR), which includes cities like Hawassa and others",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ko-03,What is the most popular children's song in Ethiopia that families sing together?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular children's song in Ethiopia that families sing together. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ethiopian music and children's songs.

Ethiopia has a rich musical tradition with various regional styles. However, when it comes to children's songs, I'm not sure about the specifics. I know that many countries have traditional lullabies or folk songs passed down through generations. Maybe there's a well-known song that's commonly taught in schools or used in cultural events.

I should consider if there are any famous Ethiopian children's songs. I remember that ""Amen"" is a popular song, but I think that's more of a spiritual or religious song, not specifically for children. Another possibility is ""Kebra Nagast,"" but that's a religious text, not a song. 

Wait, maybe ""Hailu"" or ""Tizita""? No, those are more adult songs. I'm not sure. Perhaps there's a song that's part of the Amharic language children's repertoire. Maybe something like ""Mizan"" or ""Shum"" but I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a song that's used in educational settings or kindergarten. I think ""The Alphabet Song"" might be adapted in different languages, but I don't know the Ethiopian version. 

I might be missing something here. Let me think about Ethiopian festivals or cultural practices. During holidays, families might sing traditional songs. Could it be ""Fasika"" songs? Fasika is the Ethiopian Easter, and there are songs associated with that, but again, not sure if they're specifically for children.

Alternatively, maybe it's a lullaby like ""Lullaby for a Baby"" in Amharic. But I don't know the exact title. 

Since I'm not finding a specific name, maybe I should check if there's a commonly referenced song. Wait, I recall that ""Amen"" is sometimes used in children's contexts, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""Yeku Yesus"" which is a hymn, but again, not sure if it's for children.

Given that I can't recall a specific title, perhaps the answer is that there isn't a single most popular song, but if I have to choose, maybe ""Amen"" is the closest, though I'm not certain. However, I should be careful not to guess incorrectly. Maybe the answer is ""Amen"" or another song,",1,,,,0,0
New-en-69,Which writers are commonly studied in literature class in Ethiopia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking which writers are commonly studied in literature classes in Ethiopia. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall Ethiopian literature. Ethiopia has a rich literary tradition, both in Amharic and other local languages, as well as in the diaspora. The educational system in Ethiopia includes literature as part of the curriculum, so they probably study both local and international authors.

For local writers, the most prominent ones would be those who have made significant contributions to Ethiopian literature. Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin comes to mind; he's a well-known poet and writer. Then there's Getachew Haile, who is also a notable figure. Another name is Yemane Beshah, who has written in Amharic. Also, the poet and playwright Yonas Kifle might be included. Additionally, the novelist and poet Alemayehu G. Mare is another key figure.

On the international side, Ethiopian students might study African writers in general, like Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. Also, Western authors like Shakespeare, Dickens, and others are part of the curriculum. But the question is about ""commonly studied,"" so maybe focusing more on Ethiopian and African writers rather than Western ones. However, the user didn't specify, so including both might be necessary.

Wait, the user might be looking for Ethiopian writers specifically. But the question says ""commonly studied in literature class in Ethiopia,"" which could include both local and international. However, in Ethiopian schools, they often emphasize local authors. Let me confirm that. Ethiopian literature classes typically include both local and international authors, but the focus is more on Ethiopian and African writers. So I should list Ethiopian writers first, then maybe some African and Western ones.

But the user might want a comprehensive list. Let me make sure I include the most prominent Ethiopian writers. Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin, Getachew Haile, Yemane Beshah, Alemayehu G. Mare, Yonas Kifle. Also, the novelist and poet Ato Wolde Mariam. Maybe also the poet and academic Gebre Igziabiher. Additionally, the playwright and poet Yimam Tsegaye.

For international authors, maybe the African writers like Achebe, Soyinka, and Ngũgĩ, as well as Western authors like Shakespeare, Dickens, and others. But the user's question might be more about",1,,,,0,0
