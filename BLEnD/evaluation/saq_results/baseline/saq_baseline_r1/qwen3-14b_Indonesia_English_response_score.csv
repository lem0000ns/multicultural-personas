Ji-ko-29,Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Indonesia's society?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Indonesian society. Hmm, I need to think about Indonesian cultural practices.

First, I know that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some Asian countries, the 60th birthday is a big deal because of the Chinese zodiac cycle. But does Indonesia have something similar?

Wait, Indonesia is a diverse country with various ethnic groups. The majority are Muslim, so maybe there's a connection to Islamic traditions. However, birthdays aren't as emphasized in Islam as they are in some other religions. But in Indonesia, people do celebrate birthdays, especially for children and older family members.

Another angle: in some Indonesian cultures, the 100th birthday might be a significant milestone, but that's probably rare. Maybe the 60th birthday? I recall that in some regions, like in Java, there's a tradition called ""Ulang Tahun"" which is celebrated, but I'm not sure if a specific age stands out.

Wait, there's a concept called ""Dewasa"" which is adulthood, but that's around 17-18 years old. However, that's more about coming of age rather than a birthday celebration. 

Hold on, maybe the 50th birthday? Or perhaps the 60th? I think in some parts of Indonesia, the 60th birthday is considered a major milestone, similar to the Chinese 60-year cycle. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the 10th birthday is significant for children, but that's probably not the most grandly celebrated.

Alternatively, considering the influence of Western culture, maybe the 18th birthday is important for coming of age. However, in Indonesia, the legal age of adulthood is 18, so that might be celebrated. But I'm not sure if it's the most grandly celebrated compared to other ages.

Wait, I should check if there's a specific age that's widely recognized. Another thought: in some Indonesian communities, the 7th, 12th, or 14th birthdays might be celebrated, but again, not sure about grandeur.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific age that's celebrated more than others, but the question states that there is one. Maybe the 60th birthday is the answer, as in some cultures, 60 is a",1,,,,1,1.0
New-pe-20,What sport is popular to play on the beach in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking what sport is popular to play on the beach in Indonesia. I need to figure out the most common beach sport there.

First, I know that Indonesia has a lot of beaches, so maybe something like volleyball? But wait, there's also a sport called ""sepak takraw,"" which is a traditional game similar to volleyball but using feet. However, is that played on the beach? Or is it more of an indoor or court sport?

Then there's surfing. Indonesia is known for its surfing spots, like Bali and other islands. But is surfing considered a popular sport among the general population, or more of a tourist activity? Maybe it's popular among locals too, but I'm not sure if it's the most common.

Another possibility is beach football, but I'm not certain. Or maybe something else like cricket? Wait, cricket isn't really associated with beaches in Indonesia. 

Wait, I think ""volleyball"" is played on beaches, and maybe ""beach volleyball"" is the answer. But I should confirm if that's the case in Indonesia. Alternatively, there's a traditional sport called ""sepak raga"" which is similar to sepak takraw, but again, not sure about the beach aspect.

Alternatively, considering the popularity, maybe volleyball is the answer. But I need to be accurate. Let me think again. In many countries, beach volleyball is a common sport. Indonesia might have that. However, I should check if there's a more specific answer. 

Wait, the user might be looking for ""sepak takraw"" but played on the beach. However, I think sepak takraw is usually played on a court. Maybe the answer is volleyball. Alternatively, maybe ""badminton"" but that's usually on a court too. 

Alternatively, there's a sport called ""kasti,"" which is a traditional game similar to baseball, but not sure if it's played on beaches. 

Hmm. I think the safest answer here is beach volleyball. But I need to be sure. Maybe looking up common sports in Indonesia. Wait, I can't look it up, but based on general knowledge, beach volleyball is likely. However, I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: Indonesia's national sports. The national sport is sepak bola (soccer), but that's on a field. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""volleyball"" as it's a common beach sport. But I",1,,,,1,1.0
Kik-in-37,What soccer teams in Indonesia are famous for their intense rivalry? (e.g. ___ vs ___),"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which soccer teams in Indonesia are known for their intense rivalries. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian football. The top league is Liga 1, and there are several prominent clubs.

First, there's Persija Jakarta. They're one of the most popular teams, with a big fan base. I remember hearing about a rivalry between Persija and Persipura Jayapura. Wait, but Persipura is from Papua, so maybe that's more of a regional rivalry? Or is it more about the two teams being strong competitors?

Another big name is PSMS Medan. They have a rivalry with PSM Makassar. I think that's called the ""Derby of the South"" or something similar. Both teams are from different parts of Indonesia, so maybe that's a significant rivalry.

Then there's the competition between Persib Bandung and PSIS Semarang. Wait, no, I think Persib has a more famous rivalry with PSM Makassar? Or maybe with Persija? I might be mixing things up. Let me check my memory again. Oh right, there's the ""El Clásico Indonesia"" between Persija Jakarta and Persib Bandung. That's a major rivalry, similar to how Real Madrid and Barcelona have their El Clásico. They are both top teams with large followings, so their matches are always intense.

Also, there's the rivalry between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya. They are both from East Java, so it's a local derby. These matches are known for being very passionate and sometimes heated.

Another one could be between Bali United and Madura United. They have a rivalry, especially since both are successful teams from different islands, but I'm not sure if it's as intense as the others. Maybe the Bali vs Madura rivalry is notable, but I'm not certain if it's considered one of the most intense.

Wait, I should focus on the most well-known ones. The El Clásico Indonesia between Persija and Persib is definitely a top one. Then the Arema vs Persebaya derby in East Java. Also, the PSM Makassar vs PSMS Medan rivalry. Are there others?

I think there's also a rivalry between Persela Lamongan and Persipura Jayapura, but I'm not sure how intense that is. Maybe not as much as the others. So to sum up, the main rival",1,,,,1,1.0

New-pe-49,Where do families gather to pray together in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking where families in Indonesia gather to pray together. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country, with about 87% of the population being Muslim. So, the main places of worship would be related to Islam. The most common places for prayer in Islam are mosques. But the question specifies families gathering, so maybe it's not just any mosque. 

In many Muslim cultures, families pray together at home, especially for daily prayers like Fajr or Maghrib. However, for communal prayers, especially on Fridays or during special occasions, they might go to a mosque. But the question is about where they gather to pray together, which could be either at home or in a mosque. 

Wait, but the user might be looking for specific places. In Indonesia, there are also traditional places of worship like masjids, which are similar to mosques. However, there are also other religious minorities, like Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and others. But since the majority are Muslim, the primary answer would be mosques. 

However, the question is about families gathering. In some cases, families might pray together at home, but if they go to a public place, then mosques. Also, there's the concept of ""salat berjamaah"" which is congregational prayer, usually held in mosques. But for family prayers, maybe home is more common. However, the answer might be mosques because that's the main place for communal prayer. 

Wait, but the user might not be considering home as a gathering place. The question is a bit ambiguous. However, in Indonesia, it's common for families to pray together at home, especially for daily prayers, but for larger gatherings or specific prayers, they might go to a mosque. However, the answer might be mosques as the primary place where families gather for prayer. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is both home and mosques. But the user asked for one answer in a list. Wait, the example shows a list with one item. The user says ""Provide one single answer as a list form"". So maybe the answer is mosques. But I need to confirm. 

Another angle: in some cultures, the family might gather in a specific room or area at home for prayers. However, the question might be looking for a public place. Since the majority are Muslim, the primary answer is mosques. So the answer is mosques.

Ne-ar-09,What do people from Indonesia eat in Eid ul Fitr?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what people in Indonesia eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me start by recalling what Eid ul Fitr is. It's the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. So, during this time, people celebrate with special foods.

Now, I need to think about Indonesian cuisine and their traditional dishes for this occasion. I know that in many Muslim countries, there are specific foods associated with Eid. For example, in Indonesia, they might have dishes like ""Kue Lapis"" which is a layered cake, or ""Bika Ambon,"" a type of sponge cake. Also, ""Pisang goreng"" (fried bananas) and ""Lemper"" (a sticky rice cake wrapped in banana leaves) come to mind. There's also ""Klepon,"" which are palm sugar balls filled with coconut. 

Wait, but I should make sure these are actually eaten during Eid. Maybe I should verify if these are part of the traditional Eid foods. Also, there's ""Nastar,"" which is a type of cookie with pineapple filling. And ""Kuih"" in general, which are various traditional cakes and pastries. Oh, and ""Lontong"" or ""Lemper"" might be more common as snacks. 

I should also consider that the answer needs to be in a JSON list format, and the user wants only the answer without examples. Wait, the user said ""provide one single answer as a list form"" and ""without any examples."" Wait, no, the user said ""without any examples"" but the answer should be a list. Wait, the original instruction says: ""Provide one single answer as a list form at the end in a JSON format as below. Only the answer should be given with the list, without any examples."" Hmm, maybe the user wants the answer to be a list of items, not examples. So, the list should include the actual foods people eat, not examples of how to present them. 

So, compiling all that, the answer should be a list of Indonesian dishes specific to Eid ul Fitr. I need to make sure these are correct. Let me check my memory again. Kue Lapis, Bika Ambon, Klepon, Nastar, Lemper, Pisang Goreng, and maybe also ""Kuih"" in general. Are there others? Maybe ""Pecel Lele"" but that's a main dish, not sure if it",1,,,,0,0

Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in Indonesia's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the required subjects for Indonesia's university entrance exam. First, I need to recall what I know about the Indonesian education system. The main entrance exam for universities in Indonesia is called the Ujian Nasional (UN), which is the National Exam. However, I think there have been some changes in recent years, especially with the introduction of the SBMPTN (Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri), which is the Joint Admission Test for State Universities.

Wait, so the Ujian Nasional is the national exam taken by high school students, but for university admission, the SBMPTN is the main test. So the required subjects for the SBMPTN would be the ones that are important here. The SBMPTN has different groups depending on the field of study. For example, there's the Saintek group for science and technology, which includes subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Then there's the Soshum group for social sciences, which includes subjects like Indonesian, Mathematics, Social Studies, and History. Also, there's the Campuran group which might combine some of these.

But the user is asking about the required subjects in the university entrance exam. So I need to make sure which exam they are referring to. If it's the SBMPTN, then the answer would depend on the group the student is applying to. However, the Ujian Nasional is a separate exam, but I think the SBMPTN is the primary one for university admission now.

Wait, but the user might be referring to the Ujian Nasional as part of the process. However, in recent years, the Indonesian government has been phasing out the Ujian Nasional as the main criteria for university admissions, shifting more towards the SBMPTN. So the required subjects would be those tested in the SBMPTN. Let me confirm that.

Yes, the SBMPTN is the main entrance exam for Indonesian state universities. The required subjects depend on the program the student is applying to. For example:

- Saintek (Science and Technology): Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.
- Soshum (Social Sciences): Indonesian, Mathematics, Social Studies (Sejarah, Geografi, Ekonomi, Sosiologi), and History.
- Campuran: A mix of some subjects from both groups.

New-pe-86,What is the name of the most famous tower in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the name of the most famous tower in Indonesia. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall famous towers in Indonesia. The Jakarta Cathedral comes to mind, but I'm not sure if it's considered a tower. Then there's the Menara Kudus in Semarang, which is a historic tower. Wait, but maybe the most famous one is the Jakarta Cathedral? Or perhaps the Menara Surya in Jakarta? No, Menara Surya is more of a modern building. 

Wait, another thought: the most iconic tower might be the one associated with the Jakarta Islamic Centre. But I'm not certain. Let me verify. The Menara Kudus is a well-known tower in Semarang, built in the 19th century. However, in Jakarta, there's the Jakarta Cathedral, which has a tower, but I think the Menara Kudus is more famous nationally. Alternatively, maybe the Gedung Sate in Bandung? No, that's a building, not a tower. 

Wait, another possibility: the Tower of the World Trade Center in Jakarta? But that's not as famous. Alternatively, the Merdeka Palace's tower? Hmm. I think I need to confirm which one is most recognized. Menara Kudus is a prominent historical tower, but maybe the answer is the Jakarta Cathedral's tower. However, I'm a bit confused here. Let me check my memory again. The Menara Kudus is a 19th-century tower in Semarang, and it's often cited as one of Indonesia's famous towers. Alternatively, the Jakarta Cathedral's tower is also notable. 

Wait, but the user is asking for the most famous. Maybe the answer is the Menara Kudus. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Jakarta Cathedral. I need to make sure. Another angle: search in my knowledge base. Oh, I recall that the Menara Kudus is often mentioned as a famous tower in Indonesia, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, the Gedung Sate in Bandung is a famous building but not a tower. 

Alternatively, the Tower of the Semarang Cathedral? No, that's a church. I think the Menara Kudus is the answer here. But maybe the answer is the Jakarta Cathedral's tower. Hmm. I need to decide. Let me go with Menara Kudus as the most",1,,,,0,0
Th-en-53,What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular extracurricular social event is at schools in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian schools and their activities.

First, Indonesia has a diverse culture with various traditions. Schools there might have events that reflect local customs or national holidays. Common school events worldwide include sports days, cultural festivals, talent shows, etc. But I need to focus on Indonesia specifically.

I remember that in many countries, sports events are popular. Indonesia has a strong tradition in sports like badminton and sepak bola (soccer). Maybe sports competitions are a big deal there. Also, there's a national holiday called Hari Raya Idul Fitri, which is a major Muslim holiday, but that's more of a religious event, not sure if it's an extracurricular school event.

Another possibility is cultural festivals or arts events. Indonesia has a rich cultural heritage with traditional dances, music, and crafts. Schools might organize cultural days where students showcase these aspects. That could be a possibility.

There's also the school festival or ""Pekan Olahraga dan Seni"" (Sports and Art Week) which might be a common event. These events often include sports competitions, art exhibitions, and performances. But is that the most popular?

I should check if there's any specific event that's more prevalent. Maybe the ""Pekan Olahraga Nasional"" (National Sports Week) but that's a national event, not sure if it's an extracurricular school event. Alternatively, student councils or organizations might host events like charity drives or community service, but those might not be as social or event-based.

Another angle: in many countries, prom or similar social events are popular, but Indonesia might have different traditions. However, I don't recall prom being common there. Instead, maybe graduation ceremonies or school carnivals?

Wait, considering the influence of Western culture, maybe some schools have talent shows or dance competitions. However, I'm not certain if that's the most popular.

Alternatively, considering the emphasis on community and religion in Indonesian society, religious events or charity events might be more common. But again, not sure about the extracurricular aspect.

I think the most likely answer is that sports events are the most popular. Since Indonesia has a strong sports culture, and schools often organize sports competitions as part of their extracurricular activities. Maybe something like a school sports day or inter-school competitions. But I need",1,,,,1,0.25
Ca-sp-06,Which is the most important meal of the day to people from Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which meal is the most important for people in Indonesia. Hmm, I know that in many cultures, breakfast, lunch, or dinner can be the main meal. But Indonesia has a lot of regional variations. Let me think.

From what I remember, in Indonesia, the main meals are often around lunch and dinner. Breakfast might be lighter. But I think the most significant meal is usually lunch. For example, people might have a big meal with rice, meat, and various side dishes in the afternoon. However, I'm not entirely sure if it's lunch or dinner. Wait, some sources say that in Indonesia, the main meal is often considered the evening meal, which is dinner. But I've also heard that in some regions, lunch is the bigger meal. Maybe it's a tie?

Wait, but the question is about the most important. Maybe I should check common references. I recall that in many Southeast Asian countries, the main meal is typically in the evening. However, I think in Indonesia, the most important meal is actually breakfast. No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe it's the meal that's most communal or the one with the most variety? Or perhaps it's the one that's the most elaborate.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is lunch. Let me think about typical Indonesian meals. They have nasi (rice) with various dishes like curries, satays, etc. These are often served during lunch or dinner. But which one is more significant? In some cultures, dinner is the main meal, but in others, it's lunch. I think in Indonesia, the most important meal is dinner. However, I need to be careful here. Maybe there's a consensus that it's lunch. Wait, I should verify this. 

Wait, I found some information before that in Indonesia, the main meal is usually lunch, which is the largest meal of the day. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the meal that's most associated with family gatherings. Or perhaps it's dinner. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. In some parts of Indonesia, especially in urban areas, people might have a lighter lunch and a more substantial dinner. But in rural areas, maybe lunch is the main meal. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a single most important meal, but the user is asking for one. Since the user wants a single answer, I have",1,,,,1,1.0

Th-en-45,What is the most popular weekday evening family activity in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the most popular weekday evening family activity in Indonesia. Hmm, first, I need to think about common activities that families might do together in the evenings.

In many countries, evenings are often spent with family, but what's specific to Indonesia? Let me consider the cultural aspects. Indonesia has a strong Muslim population, so maybe religious activities are common. But since it's a weekday evening, maybe not Friday prayers since that's on Fridays. However, other days might have evening prayers, but I'm not sure if that's considered a family activity.

Then there's the aspect of family time. Maybe watching TV together? Or going out for dinner? But I need to think about what's more prevalent. In some cultures, family dinners are important. However, in urban areas, maybe people have different routines. 

Another angle: Indonesia has a lot of markets and street food. Maybe visiting markets or eating street food in the evenings? But is that a family activity? Maybe, but not sure if it's the most popular.

Also, considering the work schedule, after work hours, families might gather at home. Maybe playing games, or watching TV shows. Or maybe going to a park or a local hangout spot. But I need to find the most common one.

Wait, I remember reading that in Indonesia, family gatherings often involve watching TV, especially during prime time. Maybe that's a common activity. Or perhaps attending religious events, but again, not sure about weekdays.

Alternatively, maybe it's about eating together. Family dinners are common in many cultures, including Indonesia. If the question is about the most popular, perhaps having dinner together at home is the answer. But I should verify if that's the case. However, I don't have specific data here, so I need to make an educated guess based on cultural norms.

Another thought: in some Indonesian cities, after work, families might go to malls or shopping centers, but that might be more of an individual activity. Or maybe attending community events, but those might not be daily.

Considering all this, the safest answer might be that the most popular weekday evening family activity is watching TV together. Alternatively, having dinner together. Which is more common? In many cultures, dinner is a family activity, but in Indonesia, maybe the evening is also time for family TV time.

Ta-pe-21,Where do children usually play soccer in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking where children in Indonesia usually play soccer. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many countries, kids play sports in public spaces. Indonesia has a lot of open areas. Maybe parks? But I should check if that's common there. Also, schools often have sports fields. So school grounds might be a primary place. 

Then there's the community aspect. In some places, local fields or community centers could be used. But I'm not sure if that's the main spot. Also, maybe streets or sidewalks? In some countries, kids play on the streets, but I don't know if that's the case in Indonesia. 

Wait, I've heard that in Indonesia, many children play soccer in open fields near their neighborhoods. Maybe they use local parks or empty lots. Also, schoolyards are probably a big part of it since schools have fields. 

Another thought: are there any specific facilities designated for children's sports? Maybe not as much as in some other countries. So the main places would be parks, school fields, and maybe community areas. 

I need to make sure the answer is accurate. Let me verify. A quick search in my mind: Indonesia's urban areas have parks, but in rural areas, maybe more open fields. However, the answer should be general. So combining these, the answer would include public parks, school grounds, and maybe community fields. But the user wants a single list. 

Wait, the user said ""one single answer as a list form."" So I need to list all the common places. So the answer would be [""public parks"", ""school grounds"", ""community fields""]. But maybe ""open fields"" is more specific. Alternatively, ""public parks and schoolyards"" might be more concise. 

I think the most accurate answer is that children usually play in public parks, school grounds, and community areas. But I need to check if there's a primary location. Maybe the most common is schoolyards and parks. Let me confirm. In Indonesia, many kids play in open spaces like parks or near their homes. So the answer should include public parks, school grounds, and possibly community or local fields. 

I think the answer should be a list of places where they commonly play. So the final answer would be [""public parks"", ""school grounds"", ""community fields""]. But maybe ""open fields"" is more accurate than ""community fields."" Alternatively, ""public parks and schoolyards"" could be combined. However,",1,,,,1,1.0

Ne-ar-38,Which food do people usually offer as charity in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which food is commonly offered as charity in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian culture and traditions.

First, I remember that in many Southeast Asian countries, religious practices often influence charitable acts. Indonesia is predominantly Muslim, so maybe there's a connection to Islamic traditions. During Ramadan, for example, people give to charity, but what specific food is associated with that?

I think there's something called ""sedekah"" in Indonesian culture, which refers to charitable giving. Sometimes, people might offer food as part of this. Also, during festivals or religious events, certain foods are shared. For instance, during Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, people might distribute food to the poor.

Another angle: in some cultures, specific foods are considered auspicious or symbolic. Maybe something like rice, which is a staple in Indonesia. But I'm not sure if rice is specifically used for charity. Alternatively, maybe ""nasi tumpeng,"" which is a traditional Indonesian dish served in a conical shape, often used in celebrations. However, is that given as charity?

Wait, there's also the concept of ""buka puasa,"" which is breaking the fast during Ramadan. Sometimes, people might offer meals to those who can't afford it. But what's the typical food? Maybe a simple meal like ""nasi goreng"" (fried rice) or ""sayur lodeh"" (a vegetable stew), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I've heard of ""sembako"" which refers to basic food items like rice, sugar, and cooking oil. These are often distributed as charity. However, the question is about a specific food, not a category. 

Wait, maybe ""ketupat,"" which is a type of compressed rice cake eaten during Eid. But again, is that specifically for charity?

I think I need to verify. From what I recall, in Indonesia, during Ramadan, a common practice is to distribute ""buka puasa"" meals to the poor. These meals are usually simple and include rice, meat, and vegetables. However, the specific food that's commonly offered as charity might be ""nasi tumpeng"" because it's a traditional dish used in communal settings. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe ""tumpeng"" is more for celebrations rather than charity.

Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular sportsperson in Indonesia is. Let me start by thinking about the sports that are popular there. Indonesia has a lot of athletes, but which ones are the most well-known?

First, I know that badminton is a big sport in Indonesia. There are some legendary players like Susi Susanti, who was the first Indonesian to win an Olympic gold medal in badminton. Then there's Taufik Hidayat, who won the men's singles at the 2004 Olympics. More recently, maybe someone like Anthony Sinisuka Ginting or Jonatan Christie, but I'm not sure if they're as popular as the older stars.

Another sport is boxing. There's Anthony Joshua, but wait, he's British-Indonesian, right? But he's based in the UK, so maybe not as prominent in Indonesia. Then there's maybe someone like Denny Julianus, but I'm not sure about his popularity.

Then there's football (soccer). Indonesia has a national team, but I don't think any individual players are as famous as the badminton stars. Maybe someone like Bambang Pamungkas, but he's more of a legend from the past.

What about other sports? Maybe weightlifting or athletics? I'm not sure. The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton, football, and maybe martial arts like pencak silat. But in terms of individual athletes, badminton seems to have the most household names.

So, between the old stars like Susi Susanti and Taufik Hidayat, and the newer ones. But considering popularity, maybe Taufik Hidayat is more recognized because he was a male athlete who won an Olympic gold, which might have a bigger impact. Alternatively, Susi Susanti as the first female gold medalist could be more popular. But I need to check if there's a current athlete who's more popular now.

Wait, maybe the answer is more recent. For example, maybe someone like Jonatan Christie, who has been winning tournaments recently. Or maybe a football player. But I think in the general public, badminton players are more celebrated. Also, there's the possibility that someone like Marcus Gideon or Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo in badminton doubles, but they might not be as individually popular as singles players.

Another angle: sometimes the most popular might not be the most successful.",1,,,,1,1.0
New-gr-15,What is the most popular traditional dessert in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most popular traditional dessert in Indonesia. Let me think about this. I know Indonesia has a lot of diverse regions, so there might be several popular desserts. But which one is the most popular overall?

First, I should recall some traditional Indonesian desserts. There's klepon, which is a sweet rice ball filled with palm sugar and coconut. Then there's martabak, which is a type of pancake, but I think that's more of a savory or mixed dish. Maybe not the dessert. There's also es campur, which is a mixed ice dessert, but I'm not sure if that's considered traditional or more of a modern blend.

Another one is onde-onde, which are glutinous rice balls filled with sweet filling, similar to klepon but maybe different in texture. Then there's the famous mooncake, but those are more associated with Chinese culture and maybe not as traditional in Indonesia. Wait, but Indonesia has its own version of mooncakes for Chinese New Year, but maybe not the most popular overall.

Puding (pudding) is a dessert, but I think that's more of a Western influence. Then there's the famous Indonesian cake called kue lapis, which is a layered cake, but again, not sure about its popularity compared to others.

Wait, klepon is quite famous. It's made from糯米 (glutinous rice) dough, filled with palm sugar and grated coconut, then deep-fried. It's commonly found in markets and street vendors. But I've also heard of another dessert called ""pisang goreng"" (fried bananas), but that's more of a snack.

Another possibility is ""kuih"" which are various types of traditional cakes from different regions, but they might be more regional. For example, kuih lapis from Sumatra or kuih bangkit from Malacca. But these might not be as widespread as a single dessert.

Wait, maybe ""bolu"" (a type of sponge cake) is popular, but again, that's more of a general cake. Then there's ""kueh api"" which is a type of sweet cake made from rice flour, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, ""es teler"" which is a shaved ice dessert with various toppings, but again, more of a modern treat. 

I think the most commonly mentioned traditional dessert in Indonesia is klepon. It's widely recognized and available in many places. However, there's",1,,,,1,1.0

Na-ko-20,What sports event do people from Indonesia passionately support the most in international competitions?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which sports event Indonesians support the most in international competitions. Hmm, I need to think about popular sports in Indonesia.

First, I know that Indonesia has a strong presence in badminton. They have top players like Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei, but wait, those are from China. Wait, no, Indonesia has their own stars like Taufik Hidayat and maybe current players like Jonatan Christie. Badminton is definitely a big sport there.

Then there's football (soccer). Indonesia has a national team, and football is popular globally. But I'm not sure if they're the most passionate about it compared to other sports. Maybe in terms of viewership or participation?

Another sport could be boxing. Indonesia has produced some notable boxers, like Anthony Joshua's rival, but I'm not sure about the level of support. Also, there's martial arts like pencak silat, which is traditional, but maybe not as prominent in international competitions.

Wait, the question is about international competitions. Badminton tournaments like the Thomas Cup or Uber Cup, or the BWF World Championships? Or maybe the Asian Games? But the Asian Games are regional. The user specified international, so maybe events like the Olympics or World Championships.

But the answer should be the specific sports event. So, if badminton is the most supported, then the answer would be events like the BWF World Championships or the Thomas Cup. But maybe the user is looking for the sport itself, not the specific event. Wait, the question says ""sports event,"" which could be a competition like the Olympics, but maybe the sport is badminton.

Wait, the user might be confused between sport and event. But the answer should be the event. However, in many cases, people support the sport, not a specific event. But the question says ""sports event,"" so perhaps the most popular international event they support is the Badminton World Championships or the Thomas Cup. However, in Indonesia, the national team in badminton is very popular, so people support them in international events like the World Championships or the Olympics.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Asian Games, but that's a regional event. The user specified international, so maybe the Olympics. But the main sport would be badminton. So the answer might be the Badminton World Championships or the Thomas Cup. However, I need to verify if that's the case.

New-gr-06,What is the most popular food in Indonesia among young people?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular food in Indonesia is among young people. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian cuisine. Indonesia has a diverse range of traditional foods like nasi goreng, satay, rendang, and bakso. But the question is specifically about what's popular among young people now.

I remember that in many countries, younger generations might prefer foods that are trendy, fast, or influenced by global trends. Maybe street food is popular because it's convenient and affordable. Satay, which is skewered and grilled meat, is a classic Indonesian dish, but is it still popular with youth? Also, there's the rise of food trucks and fusion dishes. 

Another thought: social media plays a big role in food trends. If a dish is photogenic or has a unique presentation, it might be more popular among younger people who are active on platforms like Instagram. For example, something like ""Es Teh Manis"" (sweet iced tea) or ""Martabak"" (a type of stuffed pancake) might be trendy. 

Wait, but I've also heard that fried chicken, like ""Ayam Goreng"" or even ""Ayam Penyet"" (squeezed fried chicken) is popular. Or maybe ""Bakso"" (meatball soup) is a favorite because it's a staple in Indonesian street food. 

Alternatively, there's the influence of Western fast food chains, but I think local street food might still be more popular. Also, health trends could be a factor. Young people might prefer lighter options, but that's not sure. 

I should check if there are any recent surveys or articles about this. But since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on existing knowledge. In Indonesia, street food is a big part of the culture, and young people often eat at street vendors. Satay is definitely a classic, but maybe something like ""Nasi Lemak"" (though that's more Malaysian) or ""Nasi Uduk"" (steamed rice with coconut milk) is popular. 

Wait, another angle: convenience. Fast food like fried chicken, fried rice, or instant noodles might be popular. But the question is about the most popular. Maybe ""Nasi Goreng"" (fried rice) is a top contender because it's widely available and adaptable. However, I think ""Satay"" is often cited as a popular street food that's enjoyed by many, including younger people",1,,,,1,0.5

Ji-ko-35,What is the most common form of private education in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most common form of private education in Indonesia. Let me think about this. I know that Indonesia has a mix of public and private schools. Private education there might include various types like international schools, religious schools, or maybe something else.

Wait, I remember that many private schools in Indonesia are religious, especially Islamic schools. There's also the presence of international schools catering to expatriates, but those might be fewer in number. Then there are also private schools that follow the national curriculum but are privately run. However, the most common one might be the Islamic schools, like madrasahs. But I need to confirm if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe it's the private schools that follow the national curriculum but are privately funded. However, I think the majority of private education in Indonesia, especially at the primary and secondary levels, are Islamic schools. They might be more prevalent because of the religious influence in the country. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my knowledge again. Yes, in Indonesia, private education often includes both religious and secular institutions. However, the largest number might be the religious ones. But wait, the question says ""most common form,"" which could refer to the type that's most widespread. Another possibility is the private schools that are not religious, but I think the Islamic schools are more common. Alternatively, maybe the answer is private schools in general, but the user is asking for the specific form. Hmm.

Wait, the answer might be ""private schools (sekolah swasta)"" which can include both religious and secular. But the most common form could be the ones that follow the national curriculum but are privately run. However, I'm not certain. Let me think again. In Indonesia, there are also private schools that are part of the national system but are privately managed. However, the largest number might be the Islamic schools, which are part of the madrasah system. But I'm not sure if that's considered the most common form of private education. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""private schools (sekolah swasta)"" as the general term. But the user might be looking for a specific type. Wait, perhaps the most common is the private schools that follow the national curriculum, but I need to make sure. I think I should go with ""private schools (sekolah swasta)"" as the general answer unless there's a more specific category. However, if the user is looking for the most prevalent type,",1,,,,1,1.0

An-ar-03,Which month is the final exam term usually scheduled at high schools in Indonesia? (Provide Arabic numerals (1~12) only.),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which month high schools in Indonesia usually schedule their final exams. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indonesian education system.

First, Indonesia follows a school year that's divided into two semesters. The academic year typically starts in July and ends in June of the following year. So, the first semester would be from July to December, and the second semester from January to June. 

Now, final exams are usually held at the end of each semester. For the first semester, that would be around December. But wait, sometimes there's a break in December for the holiday season, like Christmas and New Year. However, in Indonesia, the main public holidays are around Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, which are Islamic holidays. But I think the school year might be structured more around the general academic calendar rather than religious holidays, though there might be some adjustments.

Wait, but if the first semester ends in December, the final exams would be in December. However, I've heard that in some countries, like in the US, final exams are in June, but that's because their school year ends in June. For Indonesia, since the academic year starts in July, the first semester would be July to October, and the second semester November to June? Hmm, maybe I should check the typical structure.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the semesters. Let me think again. In many countries, the academic year is divided into two semesters. The first semester is typically from July to October, with exams in October or November. Then the second semester from November to March or April, with final exams in June. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to find a better approach.

Alternatively, Indonesia's school year might be split into two terms: the first term from July to December, with mid-term exams in October or November, and final exams in December. Then the second term from January to June, with mid-term exams in April and final exams in June. So if that's the case, the final exams for the second term would be in June. But the question is about the final exam term, which could refer to the end of the entire academic year. Since the academic year ends in June, the final exams would be in June. So the answer would be 6.

But I need to be sure. Maybe I should consider the national exam in Indonesia, which is the Ujian Nasional (UN). However, I think",1,,,,1,1.0

Na-ko-33,What symbolic food do people from Indonesia eat on (Lunar) New Year?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the symbolic food that people in Indonesia eat during Lunar New Year. Hmm, I need to recall what I know about Indonesian New Year traditions. Wait, Indonesia primarily celebrates the Lunar New Year, which is also known as Imlek, but it's more commonly associated with the Chinese community there. However, Indonesia has a diverse culture, so maybe there are specific dishes they eat.

I remember that in many Asian cultures, certain foods symbolize prosperity, luck, or good fortune. For example, in China, they eat dumplings because they look like ancient Chinese money. But what about Indonesia? Maybe they have their own version. Let me think. There's a dish called ""numpang"" or ""numpak"" which is a type of sweet rice cake. Wait, or is that in other countries? Or maybe ""kuih"" which is a general term for various traditional cakes in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia.

Alternatively, maybe they eat something like ""lontong"" or ""kerak telor,"" but those are more everyday foods. Wait, during Lunar New Year, the Chinese in Indonesia might still follow traditional Chinese customs, so maybe they eat similar foods like dumplings, fish, or spring rolls. But the question specifies ""people from Indonesia,"" not just the Chinese community. However, since the Lunar New Year is mainly celebrated by the Chinese minority, perhaps the answer refers to those dishes. But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is ""bubur,"" which is a porridge, but I don't think that's specifically for New Year.

Wait, I think in some parts of Indonesia, especially in areas with significant Chinese influence like Jakarta or Surabaya, they might eat ""char kway teow"" or ""nasi lemak"" during festivals, but those aren't specifically symbolic. Alternatively, maybe ""ketupat,"" which is a type of compressed rice cake, similar to what's eaten during Idul Fitri, but not sure about New Year. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is ""numpang"" or ""numpak,"" which are sweet rice cakes made from glutinous rice, often eaten during festivals. I think in some regions, they are associated with celebrations. Alternatively, maybe ""kuih kapit,"" which is a type of cake. But I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: in Indonesia, the Lunar New Year is called Tahun Baru Imlek, and the Chinese",1,,,,1,1.0

Gu-ch-38,"On average, how far do students typically pursue their education in Indonesia? (e.g., elementary, high school)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the average level of education that students in Indonesia pursue. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indonesian education system. Indonesia has a national education system that's structured in stages. From what I remember, the basic education consists of elementary school (SD) and middle school (SMP), which together make up 9 years. Then there's high school (SMA or SMK), which is another 3 years. After that, some students go on to higher education like university or vocational schools.

But the question is about the average. So I need to know what's typical. I think in many developing countries, not all students complete high school. Maybe the average is up to high school? But I should check if there's data on completion rates. Wait, Indonesia's education system has seen improvements, but access might still be an issue, especially in rural areas. However, the government has been pushing for universal primary education, which they achieved, but secondary education might still have lower completion rates.

I recall that the average years of schooling in Indonesia might be around 7-8 years, which would mean completing elementary and part of middle school. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the average is completing up to high school. Wait, let me think about the structure again. Elementary is 6 years, middle school 3, so 9 years total. High school is 3 more years, making 12. If the average is 9 years, then it's up to middle school. But if it's 12, then high school. However, in reality, many might not finish all 12. 

Looking up some data in my mind, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics might have data. I think Indonesia's average years of schooling is around 7.5 years. That would imply that on average, students complete elementary school (6 years) and about half of middle school. But the question is about how far they typically pursue, not the exact years. So if the average is around 7.5 years, that would be completing elementary and part of middle school. But sometimes, people might say that the typical is up to high school, but maybe that's for those who continue. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the average is completing up to high school, but I need to be accurate. Wait, I think the completion rate for secondary education (high school) in Indonesia is lower than primary. So perhaps the average is that",1,,,,1,1.0
Kik-in-16,What drink is commonly consumed in Indonesia when the weather is cold?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking what drink is commonly consumed in Indonesia when the weather is cold. Hmm, I need to think about Indonesian beverages and their typical consumption during cold weather.

First, I know that in many countries, people tend to drink warm beverages when it's cold. For example, in the West, hot chocolate or coffee is common. But Indonesia has its own traditional drinks. What are some popular Indonesian drinks?

There's teh (tea), which is very common. They often drink teh manis, which is sweet tea. But is that specifically for cold weather? Maybe not. Then there's jahe (ginger) drinks. Ginger tea is often consumed when someone is feeling cold or unwell, so maybe that's a possibility. 

Another thought: during cold weather, maybe people prefer something warm. There's also teh hangat, which is hot tea. But I'm not sure if that's specific to cold days. Also, there's a drink called wedang, which is a warm beverage. For example, wedang jahe is ginger tea, and wedang ramuan is a traditional herbal drink. These are typically served hot, so they might be consumed more when it's cold. 

But the question is about a drink commonly consumed when the weather is cold. So maybe the answer is wedang, specifically wedang jahe or another type. However, I should verify if there's a more commonly known answer. Alternatively, maybe teh manis is consumed regardless of the weather, but during cold days, people might prefer it hot. 

Wait, in Indonesia, during cold weather, people might drink warm beverages like wedang. However, I need to check if there's a specific drink that's most commonly associated with cold weather. Another possibility is kopi (coffee), but again, not sure if it's specifically for cold days. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is teh hangat (hot tea) or wedang. Since wedang is a traditional warm drink, perhaps that's the answer. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. In Indonesia, when it's cold, people might drink warm ginger tea, which is called wedang jahe. So maybe the answer is wedang jahe. However, the question might be looking for a more general answer, like ""hot tea"" or ""warm drinks."" But since the user wants a specific drink, perhaps wedang is the term they are looking for. Alternatively, maybe teh manis is consumed",1,,,,1,1.0
Al-en-39,What do people eat on their birthday in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people eat on their birthday in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian cuisine and cultural practices. Indonesia is an archipelago with diverse ethnic groups, so their birthday foods might vary by region.

First, I remember that in many Asian countries, certain foods are associated with celebrations. For example, in China, dumplings or fish might be eaten for good luck. But Indonesia has its own unique dishes. 

I think nasi goreng is a common dish there. It's fried rice with various ingredients like eggs, vegetables, and meat. Maybe that's a popular choice for birthdays because it's a staple food. Then there's satay, which are skewers of grilled meat, usually chicken or beef. Satay is often served with peanut sauce and is a popular street food, so it might be part of a birthday meal.

Another possibility is bakso, which are meatballs. They're commonly found in Indonesian street food and could be served as a main dish. Also, pisang goreng (fried bananas) or other fried snacks might be part of the celebration, especially if there are children involved.

I should also consider desserts. Kue kering, which are traditional Indonesian cookies, might be served. Or maybe something like onde-onde, which are glutinous rice balls filled with palm sugar. These are often eaten during special occasions.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if these are specifically for birthdays or just general celebrations. Maybe I should check if there are any specific dishes that are traditionally eaten on birthdays. However, since I can't look it up, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. 

In some regions, like Java, there might be specific dishes. For example, gudeg, which is a sweet and sour dish made with young jackfruit, is from Yogyakarta. But I don't know if it's specifically for birthdays. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is more about common celebratory foods rather than region-specific ones. So, the main dishes would include nasi goreng, satay, bakso, and various desserts like kue kering or onde-onde. Also, maybe some fruits like durian or mango, which are popular in Indonesia. 

Wait, but the user asked for what people eat on their birthday. It's possible that the answer includes both main dishes and desserts. So compiling the list: nasi goreng, satay, bakso, kue kering, onde-on",1,,,,0,0
Ne-ar-26,What is the most famous public corporation in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most famous public corporation in Indonesia. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall which companies are well-known in Indonesia. Public corporations usually refer to companies that are publicly traded on the stock exchange.

Indonesia has several major companies. There's Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), which is one of the largest banks. Then there's PT Astra International, which is involved in various sectors like automotive and agriculture. Also, PT Pertamina is a state-owned oil and gas company, which is quite prominent. PT Telkom Indonesia is another big name in telecommunications.

Wait, but which one is the most famous? Maybe it depends on the sector. Pertamina is a state-owned enterprise and very significant in the energy sector. However, in terms of market capitalization or public recognition, maybe BRI is larger. Let me check. BRI is the largest bank in Indonesia by assets. But Pertamina is a major player in the energy sector. Another possibility is PT Unilever Indonesia, which is part of Unilever, but I'm not sure if it's considered a public corporation anymore.

Alternatively, there's PT Indosat Ooredoo, a telecommunications company. But I think Pertamina might be more well-known nationally. However, I should verify if there's a consensus on this. Since the question is about the most famous, and considering state-owned enterprises, Pertamina is often highlighted. But maybe the answer is Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) because it's the largest bank and has a significant presence. Wait, I need to be accurate here. Let me think again. 

In terms of public recognition, Pertamina is a household name because it's involved in fuel and energy, which is a daily necessity. However, BRI is a major financial institution. Another angle: the most famous might be based on brand recognition. For example, in the consumer goods sector, there's PT Unilever Indonesia, but I'm not sure if that's the most famous. Alternatively, PT Astra International is a large conglomerate. 

Hmm, perhaps the answer is Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) because it's the largest bank and has a significant influence. However, I'm not entirely certain. I might need to confirm which one is more commonly recognized. Alternatively, maybe PT Pertamina is the most famous. Let me check my knowledge again. 

Wait, in Indonesia, Pertamina is a state-owned company and is very well",1,,,,1,0.6666666666666666
Ji-ko-36,Which subject’s academy/private educational institute do middle or high students most frequently attend in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Indonesia attend most frequently. Let me start by thinking about the common subjects in the Indonesian education system.

First, the main subjects in school would be things like Math, Science, Indonesian Language, English, Social Studies, etc. But when it comes to private academies or tutoring centers, students often focus on subjects they find challenging or that are important for exams.

In Indonesia, the national exam, called the Ujian Nasional (UN), is a big deal for high school students. The subjects tested include Math, Indonesian, English, Science, and Social Studies. However, private institutes might focus more on specific areas where students need extra help.

I remember that in many countries, including Indonesia, students often attend private tutoring for subjects like Math and Science because these are typically more challenging and have a significant impact on exam scores. Also, English is another subject where students might seek extra help, especially since it's a global language and important for higher education.

But wait, I've heard that in Indonesia, there's a lot of emphasis on English proficiency, so maybe there are many English academies. However, considering the structure of the education system, maybe Math and Science are more common because they are part of the core curriculum and require more structured tutoring.

Another angle is the popularity of specific tutoring centers. For example, in some countries, there are well-known chains for math tutoring. I'm not sure about Indonesia, but maybe similar trends exist. Also, subjects like Indonesian Language might not require as much private tutoring since it's the native language, although grammar and writing might still be areas of focus.

Wait, but the question is about which subject's academy students attend most frequently. So, the answer might be math or science, but I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe it's English. Let me think about the demand. If students are preparing for the national exam, they might need help in all core subjects, but which one is the most common?

In some regions, math is known to be a tough subject, so more students might take private classes for that. Also, STEM subjects are often prioritized for university entrance, which could lead to more students attending science academies.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a single subject. But the question asks for the most frequent. I think in Indonesia, the most common private academies are for Math and Science, but I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that English is",1,,,,1,1.0
Th-en-51,Which subject is considered the most important for students in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question: ""Which subject is considered the most important for students in Indonesia?"" Hmm, I need to figure out what's the primary subject that's emphasized the most there. 

First, I know that in many countries, subjects like math, science, or language are crucial. But Indonesia has its own education system. Let me think about their curriculum. They have a national exam called the Ujian Nasional, which is important for students. What subjects are tested there?

I remember that Indonesian students study subjects like Bahasa Indonesia (the national language), Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and maybe Religion. Since the national exam is a big deal for getting into high school or university, the subjects that are part of that exam might be considered more important. 

But which one is the most important? In some contexts, math and science are prioritized because they're seen as foundational for future careers and higher education. However, in Indonesia, there's a strong emphasis on religious education as well, especially since the country is predominantly Muslim. So maybe Islamic Studies or Religious Education is a key subject. 

Wait, but the question is about the most important. I should check if there's any official data or common consensus. From what I've read, in Indonesia's education system, subjects like Mathematics and Science are often highlighted as critical for developing analytical skills. However, the national curriculum includes religious education as a mandatory subject. 

But which one is considered the most important? Maybe it's a combination, but the user wants a single answer. Let me think again. In the context of academic performance and future opportunities, subjects like Mathematics might be more emphasized. However, in terms of cultural and religious significance, Religious Education might be considered more important. 

Wait, but the answer might depend on the context. For example, in the national exams, which subjects are weighted more? If the exams have more questions on Math or Science, that might be the answer. Alternatively, if the government or society prioritizes religious education more, that could be it. 

Looking up some sources, I find that in Indonesia, the Ministry of Education emphasizes STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) for national development. However, religious education is also a core part of the curriculum. But which one is considered the most important? 

Another angle: in the Indonesian school system, students have to take exams in several subjects, and the ones that are part of the national exam are crucial. However, the most important might be the",1,,,,1,1.0
New-ch-07,What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what food items people in Indonesia typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian cuisine and drinking habits.

First, Indonesia has a diverse range of traditional foods, influenced by various cultures like Javanese, Balinese, Malay, and others. Common dishes include things like nasi goreng (fried rice), satay (skewered meat), gado-gado (vegetable salad with peanut sauce), and rendang (spiced meat). But how do these pair with hard liquor?

Wait, in many cultures, hard liquor is paired with snacks or specific dishes that can balance the strong flavors. In Indonesia, I know that when people drink arak (a traditional spirit made from palm sap), they might have it with certain foods. Also, during social gatherings or ceremonies, there might be specific food pairings.

But the question is about hard liquor in general. So maybe looking at both local spirits and imported ones. For example, in some regions, people might drink tuak (a local alcohol) with certain dishes. However, I'm not sure if that's considered hard liquor. Also, when Indonesians consume imported hard liquors like whiskey or vodka, what do they pair them with?

I should consider both local and imported hard liquors. Traditional pairings might include salty or spicy foods to complement the alcohol. For example, in many Asian countries, salty snacks like nuts, dried meats, or pickles are common. In Indonesia, maybe things like krupuk (crackers), emping (a type of snack made from melinjo fruit), or even satay.

Another angle: during festivals or celebrations, certain dishes are served. For instance, during Galungan in Bali, there are offerings that include various foods, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to pairing with alcohol.

Also, street food might be a common pairing. Things like pisang goreng (fried bananas) or bakso (meatballs) could be eaten with alcohol. But I need to verify if these are typically paired with hard liquor specifically.

Wait, but in some contexts, people might drink hard liquor with more substantial meals. For example, when having a meal with friends, they might have a drink with the main course. So dishes like nasi goreng, rendang, or ayam goreng (fried chicken) could be paired with hard liquor.

However, I should be careful not to assume. Maybe there's a specific list of common",1,,,,1,1.0

Sa-en-31,What is Indonesia's most popular family pet?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular family pet in Indonesia is. Let me start by recalling what I know about pets in Indonesia. Indonesia is an archipelago with a diverse culture, and I know that dogs and cats are common pets in many countries, but maybe there's something different here.

I remember that in some Southeast Asian countries, people keep exotic pets like birds or reptiles. Indonesia has a lot of bird species, so maybe parrots or other birds are popular. Also, there's the tradition of keeping certain animals for companionship. However, I'm not sure if birds are the most common. 

Wait, I think in Indonesia, dogs are quite popular as pets. But I also recall that in some regions, people might prefer cats. However, considering the cultural aspects, maybe there's a specific breed or type that's more common. Alternatively, could it be something like a specific kind of dog, like the Indonesian breed? Or maybe it's not a dog or cat at all. 

Another angle: looking at pet ownership statistics. But since I don't have access to current data, I have to rely on general knowledge. In many parts of Asia, dogs are often kept as family pets. However, in some countries, like Japan, cats are very popular. But Indonesia's situation might be different. 

I've also heard about the ""kucing"" (cat) being a common pet, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the ""anjing"" (dog). However, I think in Indonesia, dogs are more commonly kept as guard dogs, while cats might be more common as indoor pets. But I'm not sure which is more popular overall.

Wait, there's also the possibility of other pets like birds, such as the lovebird or cockatiel, which are popular in Indonesia. They are colorful and can be kept in homes. Maybe birds are more popular than dogs or cats. 

I need to check if there's any cultural or traditional reason for this. For example, in some cultures, keeping certain animals is more common. However, without specific data, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, looking at online sources or common knowledge, I think that in Indonesia, dogs are the most popular family pets. But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: maybe the answer is the dog, but I should verify. 

Wait, I think I've seen articles mentioning that dogs are the most common pets in Indonesia, but I'm not sure if that",1,,,,1,1.0
Gu-ch-08,What is the most popular sports among children in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular sports among children in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Indonesia. Indonesia is an archipelago with a lot of cultural diversity, so maybe traditional sports are popular. But also, there are international sports that might be widely played.

First, I remember that badminton is very popular in Indonesia. They have a strong national team, and I think it's a common sport for kids to play. Then there's soccer (football), which is a global phenomenon and likely popular there too. Maybe basketball? I'm not sure. Also, traditional sports like sepak takraw, which is a type of kick volleyball, might be popular. But I need to check if these are more for adults or children.

Wait, children might be more into team sports that are easy to play. Soccer is definitely a big one. Then badminton is also common because it's played in schools and communities. Maybe also swimming, since Indonesia has a lot of islands and beaches. But I'm not certain about the ranking.

I should also consider the infrastructure. If there are more courts for badminton or soccer, that might influence popularity. Also, media exposure. If Indonesian athletes excel in a sport, kids might be inspired to play it. For example, Indonesia has produced famous badminton players, so that could make it popular among children.

Another angle: school sports programs. Which sports are commonly taught in schools? If badminton and soccer are part of the curriculum, they might be more popular. Also, maybe martial arts like pencak silat, which is a traditional Indonesian martial art. But is that more for adults or practiced by children?

I think the top two would be badminton and soccer. Maybe basketball is also up there. But I need to confirm. Let me think about any articles or data I've seen. From what I recall, badminton is definitely a top sport in Indonesia, and soccer is also very popular. So combining these, the answer might be badminton and soccer as the most popular. However, the question asks for the most popular, so maybe just one? But the example answer in the user's message shows a list, so maybe multiple.

Wait, the user's example shows a list, but the question is phrased as ""most popular sports"" which could be plural. So maybe list the top ones. But I need to be accurate. Let me check my knowledge again. Yes,",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ch-32,What office software do people typically use in the workplace in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what office software is commonly used in the workplace in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about office software. The big names are Microsoft Office, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), and maybe some others like LibreOffice or OpenOffice. But I'm not sure about the specific usage in Indonesia.

First, Microsoft Office is pretty widespread globally. In many countries, companies use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. So Indonesia might be similar. But I should check if there's a trend towards cloud-based solutions. Google Workspace is popular in some regions because of its collaboration features and cost-effectiveness. Maybe Indonesian companies use that too.

Then there's the possibility of local alternatives or government-endorsed software. I remember that Indonesia has some local software companies, but I'm not sure if they're widely used in offices. Maybe not as much as international options. Also, some companies might use free versions or open-source software like LibreOffice, especially if they're budget-conscious.

Another angle is the influence of multinational corporations operating in Indonesia. If big MNCs use Microsoft Office, their Indonesian branches might follow suit. Also, the education system in Indonesia might use certain software, which could influence workplace usage. For example, if schools teach Microsoft Office, employees might be more familiar with it.

I should also consider the economic aspect. Microsoft Office can be expensive, so some smaller businesses might opt for free alternatives. However, many businesses might still prefer the familiarity and features of Microsoft, even if they pay for it. Google Workspace offers a free tier with basic features, which might be attractive for startups or small businesses.

Are there any reports or surveys about software usage in Indonesia? I don't have access to current data, but based on general trends, Microsoft Office and Google Workspace are likely the top two. Maybe also some local software, but I'm not certain. To be safe, I'll stick with the major international ones unless there's a strong indication otherwise.

So, putting it all together, the answer would be Microsoft Office and Google Workspace. I should check if there's any other major player. Maybe Apple's iWork suite, but that's more for Mac users and might not be as common in a country where Windows is more prevalent. Also, cloud storage solutions like Dropbox or OneDrive might be used alongside, but they're not office software per se.

Therefore, the most probable answer is that people in Indonesia typically use Microsoft Office and Google Workspace. I'll list those in the JSON as",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ch-16,What is the most famous sports-related movie in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most famous sports-related movie in Indonesia is. Let me start by recalling any Indonesian films that are well-known. I know that Indonesia has a rich cinema history, but sports movies might be less common compared to other genres.

First, I'll think about popular Indonesian actors or directors who might have been involved in sports films. Maybe there's a movie that's widely recognized. I remember a film called ""Laskar Pelangi"" which is about a group of students, but that's more of a drama. Another one is ""Pengabdi Setan,"" but that's a horror movie. 

Wait, there's a movie titled ""Badai Pasti Berlalu"" (The Storm Will Surely Pass), but I think that's more of a drama about a family. Maybe I'm mixing up titles. Let me try to search my memory for any sports-related films. 

Oh, there's a film called ""Bola Dunia"" (World Ball) which is about a football team. But I'm not sure if that's the most famous. Alternatively, ""Laskar Pelangi"" was a big hit, but again, not specifically sports. 

Wait, perhaps ""Sang Pencerah"" (The Enlightened One) is about a sports coach? No, that's more of a biographical film about a teacher. Maybe I'm not thinking of the right one. 

Alternatively, maybe a recent movie. Let me think. There's ""Bukan Berawal dari Cinta"" which is a romantic comedy, not sports. Hmm. 

Wait, I think there's a film called ""Petenis"" (The Tennis Player) but I don't recall much about it. Or maybe ""Sepak Bola"" (Football) related movies. 

Alternatively, maybe the most famous is ""Laskar Pelangi"" even though it's not strictly sports. But perhaps the user is looking for a specific sports movie. 

Wait, perhaps ""Badai Pasti Berlalu"" is actually about a sports team. No, I think that's about a family dealing with a father's illness. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a film based on a real sports event. For example, maybe the 2018 Asian Games, but I don't recall any major films about that. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Pengabdi Setan 2"" has a sports element? No, that's horror.

New-ch-38,Which cities or regions are known for their import and export activities in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which cities or regions in Indonesia are known for their import and export activities. First, I need to recall the major economic hubs in Indonesia. Jakarta comes to mind immediately because it's the capital and the political, financial, and commercial center. The Port of Tanjung Priok in Jakarta is one of the busiest in the country, handling a lot of imports and exports.

Then there's Surabaya, which is the second-largest city. I remember that Surabaya has a significant port as well, maybe the Port of Tanjung Perak. It's a key port for regional trade, especially with neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. So Surabaya should be on the list.

Next, Medan in North Sumatra. The Port of Belawan is there, and I think it's a major gateway for trade with Malaysia and other countries. Medan is an important economic center in the northern part of the island.

Batam, which is part of the Riau Islands, is a special economic zone. It's known for manufacturing and exports, especially electronics and automotive parts. The Batam Industrial Estate is a big area for export-oriented industries. So Batam should be included.

Semarang in Central Java has the Port of Tanjung Emas. It's a significant port for trade within Indonesia and with other countries. Semarang is a major city in Java, so its port would be busy with both imports and exports.

There's also Makassar in South Sulawesi with the Port of Makassar. It's a key port in the eastern part of Indonesia, handling trade with Australia, Papua New Guinea, and other regions. So Makassar is another important city.

Another region to consider is the province of West Java, especially around the Port of Merak, but I'm not sure if Merak is as prominent as the others. However, the main cities like Jakarta and Surabaya are already covered. Maybe include the Riau Islands for Batam, but since Batam is part of the Riau Islands, maybe just list Batam as a city.

Wait, the question says cities or regions. So if a region like the Riau Islands is considered, but Batam is a city within it. Alternatively, maybe the special economic zones are regions. But the user might be looking for specific cities. Let me check again.

Also, Bandung is known for manufacturing, but does it have a",1,,,,1,1.0
New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Indonesia? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indonesian education system. Middle school in Indonesia is typically referred to as SMP (Sekolah Menengah Pertama), which is for students around 12 to 15 years old, covering grades 7 to 9.

Now, the curriculum in Indonesia is regulated by the Ministry of Education. The core subjects usually include things like Indonesian language, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, English, and Religious Education. But I should check if there are more subjects. For example, in many countries, middle schools also teach subjects like Physical Education, Arts, Music, and maybe some practical subjects like Information Technology or Life Skills.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. Let me think. In the Indonesian curriculum, there are mandatory subjects (wajib) and elective ones (peminatan). However, the question is about the number of subjects taught, which might include both mandatory and elective. But I need to confirm how many are standard across all middle schools.

I remember that in the 2013 curriculum, which is currently in use, the subjects include:

1. Indonesian Language (Bahasa Indonesia)
2. Mathematics (Matematika)
3. Science (Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam, IPA)
4. Social Studies (Ilmu Pengetahuan Sosial, IPS)
5. English (Bahasa Inggris)
6. Religious Education (Pendidikan Agama)
7. Civic Education (Pendidikan Pancasila dan Kewarganegaraan, PPKn)
8. Physical Education (Pendidikan Jasmani, Olahraga, dan Kesehatan, PJOK)
9. Art and Culture (Seni Budaya)
10. Information and Communication Technology (Tik)
11. Life Skills (Keterampilan Hidup)
12. Indonesian National Education (Pendidikan Kewarganegaraan, but that might overlap with PPKn)
Wait, maybe some of these are combined or have different names. Also, there might be practical subjects like Laboratory Work for Science, but I think those are part of the main subjects.

Alternatively, some sources mention that there are around 12 subjects in total. However, I need to be careful not to double count. For example, Civic Education and Religious Education are separate. Also, there's a subject",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ha-08,What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Indonesia. Let me start by thinking about Indonesian cuisine. There are a lot of different dishes, but some might be more bitter or spicy, which kids might not like.

First, I remember that some traditional Indonesian dishes use ingredients like turmeric, galangal, or certain types of spices that can be strong. Maybe something like ""sayur lodeh,"" which is a coconut milk-based vegetable stew with spices. But I'm not sure if children dislike that. Alternatively, there's ""rendang,"" which is a slow-cooked beef dish with a lot of spices. It's quite rich and maybe too intense for kids.

Wait, there's also a dish called ""tempe"" which is a soy-based product, often fried. It's common in Indonesia, but maybe the texture is not appealing to children. However, I'm not sure if it's specifically disliked by them. Another possibility is ""kolang kaling,"" which is a sweet snack made from palm fruit. But that's more of a sweet, so maybe not.

Oh, there's a dish called ""sambal,"" which is a spicy condiment. Kids might not like the spiciness, but elderly people might enjoy it more. However, sambal is usually a side dish, not a main course. Maybe ""lontong,"" which is rice cake with a spicy peanut sauce. The peanut sauce could be too strong for kids.

Wait, another thought: ""tahu"" (tofu) is common, but sometimes it's served with a spicy or strong sauce. Or maybe ""soto,"" a soup that can be quite rich. But again, not sure about the age preference.

Alternatively, there's a dish called ""bakso,"" which is meatball soup. It's popular, but maybe not disliked by children. Hmm.

I think I need to think about foods that are more bitter or have a stronger taste. Maybe ""sayur asem,"" which is a sour and spicy vegetable soup. The sourness and spices might be too much for kids, but the elderly might prefer it. Or ""urap,"" which is a dish made with shredded cassava or coconut, mixed with spices. It's quite strong in flavor.

Al-en-36,What food is associated with Halloween in Indonesia?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking what food is associated with Halloween in Indonesia. Hmm, I need to think about Indonesian cuisine and any possible connections to Halloween.

First, Halloween is more of a Western holiday, so I wonder if Indonesia has any traditional foods that are linked to it. Maybe they have their own festivals similar to Halloween? Wait, Indonesia has various traditional festivals, but Halloween isn't widely celebrated there. However, maybe some Western foods have been adopted.

Alternatively, maybe there are foods that are eaten during certain times of the year that coincide with Halloween. Let me think. In Indonesia, there's the Day of the Dead, but that's more of a Mexican tradition. Indonesia has its own Day of the Dead celebrations, like Nyepi, but that's during the Balinese New Year, which is in March or April. So not related to Halloween.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the growing trend of Halloween parties in Indonesia, even though it's not a traditional holiday. In that case, people might serve Western Halloween foods like pumpkin pies, candy, or cookies. But are there any local Indonesian foods that are associated with it?

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific dish that's eaten around October, which is when Halloween is. Let me check. In Indonesia, October is part of the harvest season, so maybe some harvest foods? But I'm not sure if that's linked to Halloween specifically.

Another angle: sometimes, during Halloween, people in Indonesia might make jack-o'-lanterns with pumpkins, but I don't think pumpkins are a traditional Indonesian food. However, maybe there are local versions of Western Halloween treats. For example, in some places, they might make sweet treats or snacks that are similar to candy, like dodol or other sweet pastries. But I'm not certain if these are specifically associated with Halloween.

Wait, maybe there's no specific traditional Indonesian food linked to Halloween. The answer might be that there isn't a specific food associated with Halloween in Indonesia, as it's not a traditional holiday there. However, if people do celebrate Halloween, they might adopt Western foods like chocolate, candy, or pumpkin-based dishes. But since the question is about what is associated, perhaps the answer is that there is no traditional Indonesian food linked to Halloween, but if any, maybe they use Western-style treats.

Alternatively, maybe there's a local dish that's similar to Western Halloween foods. For example, in Indonesia, there's a sweet called ""kue k",1,,,,1,1.0
