New-ko-02,What is the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about prenatal care in Iran.

First, I know that in many countries, prenatal education includes things like attending classes, workshops, or seminars on topics like nutrition, exercise, labor preparation, and baby care. But I'm not sure about Iran specifically.

I remember that in some Middle Eastern countries, there's a strong emphasis on traditional practices and family involvement. Maybe in Iran, prenatal education is influenced by both traditional methods and modern medical advice. However, the question is about the most popular activity, so I need to find out which one is most commonly practiced.

I should consider possible sources. Maybe looking into government health programs or common practices. Iran has a national health system, so perhaps they have structured prenatal education programs. I've heard that in some countries, antenatal classes are common, but I'm not sure if that's the case in Iran.

Another angle: cultural factors. In Iran, family and community support are important. Maybe prenatal education involves group sessions where women gather with other expectant mothers and healthcare providers. Alternatively, there might be a focus on traditional midwifery practices or herbal remedies, but those might be more about treatment than education.

Wait, I think I've read somewhere that in Iran, prenatal education often includes group classes conducted by midwives or healthcare professionals. These classes might cover topics like breathing techniques, nutrition, and what to expect during labor. But I need to verify if this is the most popular.

Alternatively, could it be something like home visits by healthcare workers? Or maybe online resources, but I'm not sure about internet access and usage for this purpose in Iran.

Another thought: Iran's Ministry of Health might have specific programs. For example, they might promote regular prenatal check-ups and education as part of their maternal health initiatives. If that's the case, then attending prenatal check-ups with educational components might be the most popular activity.

But the question is about ""education activity,"" which might be separate from check-ups. Maybe the answer is that attending prenatal classes or workshops is the most popular. However, I need to be certain.

I should also consider if there are any studies or reports on this. For example, a quick search in my mind (since I can't actually browse) might suggest that in Iran, group prenatal education sessions are encouraged, especially through the health system. These sessions might be held in clinics or community centers.

Alternatively, could it",1,,,,,
Ji-ko-29,Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Iran's society?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Iran's society. Hmm, I need to think about Iranian culture and traditions.

First, I know that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some places, the 13th birthday is a big deal, like a quincea침era in Latin America. But in Iran, maybe it's different. Wait, I remember hearing about a tradition called ""Sadeh"" in Iran. Sadeh is a festival that's celebrated on the 13th day of the first month of the Persian calendar, which is called Farvardin. But wait, Sadeh is more of a festival related to the end of winter and the arrival of spring, not exactly a birthday. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, there's the concept of ""Nowruz,"" which is the Persian New Year, celebrated on the vernal equinox, usually around March 21st. Nowruz is a major holiday in Iran, but again, it's a new year celebration, not a birthday. However, Nowruz is associated with the beginning of a new year, so maybe people have special celebrations for their birthdays that coincide with Nowruz? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is about a specific age, like turning 13 or 15. In some cultures, the 13th birthday is significant. But in Iran, perhaps the 13th year is important. However, I'm not certain. Another thought: in some Middle Eastern countries, the 50th birthday is a big deal, known as ""Ghuchan"" in some places. But is that the case in Iran?

Alternatively, maybe the answer is related to the age of 13, as in the ""Sadeh"" festival, but that's a festival, not a birthday. Maybe the confusion comes from the term ""Sadeh"" meaning 13, but the festival is not a birthday. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is that there isn't a specific age's birthday celebrated more grandly, but the question says ""the most grandly,"" so there must be an answer. Let me check some sources. Oh, I recall that in Iran, the 13th birthday is sometimes celebrated with more significance, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the 15th or 20th. Wait, I think there",1,,,,1,1.0

Jod-ch-07,"How long (in hours) on average does it take for people in Iran to have dinner at a restaurant? (Provide Arabic numerals up to one decimal point (e.g., 2, 3.5) only.)","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know the average time people in Iran spend having dinner at a restaurant, in hours, up to one decimal point.

First, I need to recall if there's any existing data on dining durations in Iran. I don't have specific statistics on this. But maybe I can infer based on general cultural practices or similar countries. 

In many Middle Eastern countries, dinner times can vary. Some people might have a quick meal, especially in urban areas where people are busy. However, family dinners might take longer. But how does this translate to restaurant dining?

In some cultures, dining out can be more leisurely. For example, in countries like Lebanon or Turkey, people might spend a couple of hours at a restaurant. But Iran's situation might be different. Considering economic factors, maybe meals are quicker? Or perhaps social habits encourage longer stays.

Wait, but without specific data, it's risky to assume. The user might be expecting a general estimate. If I can't find precise numbers, maybe the answer is around 1.5 to 2 hours? But I should check if there are any studies or surveys.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at average restaurant meal times globally. In the US, a typical dinner might be 1-2 hours. In Europe, sometimes longer. But again, not specific to Iran.

Since there's no concrete data, maybe the best approach is to state that there's no available data, but provide a plausible estimate based on similar regions. However, the user wants a numerical answer. If I have to give a number, maybe 1.5 hours as an average? But I need to be cautious not to provide incorrect information.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no reliable data, but since the user requires a numerical answer, I have to make an educated guess. Let me think again. If I can't find specific info, perhaps the safest answer is that it's not available. However, the user might expect an approximate value. Let me check if there are any sources. 

After some consideration, since I can't find exact data, the answer might be that there's no precise average, but for the sake of the question, I'll go with 1.5 hours as a reasonable estimate. But I need to make sure I'm not making up numbers. Maybe another approach: think about the time people spend in restaurants. In some places, dinner might take 2 hours, but if it's a quick meal,",1,,,,1,1.0

Jod-ch-60,What is the duration (in hours) of a typical workday in Iran? (Provide Arabic numerals (0~24) only.),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the typical workday duration in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about work hours in different countries. In many Western countries, the standard workday is around 8 hours, like 9 to 5. But I think in some Middle Eastern countries, the work hours might be different. 

I remember that Iran has a different work schedule, maybe because of religious practices or cultural norms. For example, some countries have shorter workdays, like 7.5 hours, or maybe even less. I think in Iran, the workday might be around 8 hours, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I've heard that some countries in the Middle East have a 7.5-hour workday, but I need to confirm if that applies to Iran.

Another angle: sometimes the workday is split into two shifts, but the total hours might still be around 8. Also, considering daylight hours, but I don't think that's a factor here. Maybe looking at labor laws. Iran's labor law might specify the standard work hours. I think the standard is 8 hours a day, 48 hours a week. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, some sources might mention 7.5 hours. I need to check if there's any official data or reliable sources that indicate the exact number.

Wait, I think in some parts of Iran, especially in government sectors, the workday might be shorter. For example, maybe 7.5 hours. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me try to recall any articles or information I've come across. I think the typical workday in Iran is 8 hours, but some sources might say 7.5. However, the most commonly cited figure is 8 hours. But I need to be accurate here. Maybe the official workday is 8 hours, but in practice, it might vary. However, the question asks for the typical duration, so the standard answer is likely 8 hours. But I'm a bit confused because I've also heard of 7.5. Let me think again. 

Wait, according to some international labor organization data or reports, Iran's standard workday is 8 hours. So I think the answer is 8. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 7.5. I need to resolve this. Maybe looking at the government's official working hours. If",1,,,,1,1.0

Ne-ar-09,What do people from Iran eat in Eid ul Fitr?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about what people in Iran eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me think about this. Eid ul Fitr is the Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, so the foods would be celebratory and traditional.

First, I should recall common Iranian dishes during holidays. I know that in Iran, they have specific sweets and dishes for such occasions. For example, ""Sholeh Zard"" is a Persian rice pudding with saffron and orange blossom water, which is often served during celebrations. Then there's ""Faloodeh,"" a refreshing drink made with rose water and ice, which might be popular during the festive season.

Another possibility is ""Kashk-e Bademjan,"" which is a yogurt and eggplant dish, but I'm not sure if that's specific to Eid. Maybe ""Ghormeh Sabzi,"" a herb stew with meat, but that's more of a regular dish. Wait, during Eid, they might have more desserts. ""Nan-e Berenji"" is a type of rice cake, but I'm not certain. 

Also, ""Shirin Polo"" is a sweet rice dish, but I think that's more associated with Nowruz. Maybe ""Kookoo"" dishes, like ""Kookoo Sabzi"" (herb frittata), but again, not sure about Eid specifically. 

Wait, I should verify. Eid ul Fitr in Iran is called ""Eid-e Fitri"" or ""Shirin Eid."" Common foods include sweets like ""Sholeh Zard,"" ""Faloodeh,"" and ""Shirin Polo."" Also, ""Baklava"" might be served, but that's more common in other regions. Maybe ""Kashk-e Bademjan"" is eaten, but I'm not entirely certain. 

I think the main ones are Sholeh Zard and Faloodeh. Let me check if there are others. ""Gaz"" is a type of dessert made with rose water and sugar, which might be eaten. Also, ""Tahdig"" is a type of crispy rice, but that's more of a regular dish. 

So compiling this, the most likely answers are Sholeh Zard, Faloodeh, and maybe Gaz. I should list those as the primary foods. I need to make sure these are specific to Eid in Iran. Maybe also ""Shirin Polo"" (sweet rice) and ""Kash",1,,,,,
New-su-24,What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about sports that parents and children commonly play together in Iran. First, I need to think about the cultural context. Iran has a rich tradition of family-oriented activities, and sports are often a way for families to bond.

I know that football (soccer) is super popular in Iran. Maybe families play it together, even if it's just casual games in the park or backyard. Then there's volleyball. I've heard that beach volleyball is popular, but maybe indoor volleyball is also played by families.

Another possibility is traditional games. For example, ""Koohpayeh"" or ""Koohpay"" is a traditional Iranian game similar to tug-of-war. That's something kids and adults might do together. Also, ""Sepak Takraw"" is a sport that's popular in some regions, but I'm not sure if it's commonly played by families.

Badminton could be another option. It's a common sport in many countries and requires minimal equipment, so families might play it together. Then there's chess or backgammon, which are traditional games in Iran. While not physical sports, they are played by families, including parents and children.

Wait, the question specifies sports, so maybe focus on physical activities. So, football, volleyball, badminton, and traditional games like Koohpayeh. Maybe also swimming, but I'm not certain about its prevalence in family settings. Also, ""Gheymeh"" is a traditional sport, but I'm not sure about its current popularity.

I should verify if these are indeed common. Football is definitely a given. Volleyball and badminton are likely. Koohpayeh is a traditional game, so that's probably included. Maybe also ""Kabaddi,"" but I think that's more common in South Asia. So, narrowing it down to football, volleyball, badminton, and Koohpayeh. Also, maybe ""Shuttlecock"" games like Sepak Takraw, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""Polo"" is a traditional sport, but it's more of a spectator sport now.

Another thought: ""Koohpayeh"" is definitely a family game. Also, ""Kooh Pay"" or ""Kooh Pae"" is played with a ball and a stick, similar to a game of tag or a ball game. Maybe that's the one. Also, ""Kite flying"" is a common activity, but not sure if it",1,,,,1,1.0
Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in Iran's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the required subjects for Iran's university entrance exam. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Iranian education system. The main university entrance exam in Iran is called the Konkur. From what I remember, the Konkur is a competitive exam that students take after completing high school to gain admission to universities.

Now, the subjects required would depend on the field of study the student wants to pursue. For example, there are different tracks like humanities, sciences, and maybe technical fields. Let me break it down. 

For the humanities track, the required subjects might be Persian literature, Islamic studies, history, geography, and maybe some math and science topics. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact list. Then for the sciences track, subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and possibly some general knowledge. 

Wait, I think the Konkur has different parts. There's a general section that all students take, and then specialized sections based on their chosen field. The general subjects might include Persian language, Islamic studies, and maybe some logical reasoning or general knowledge. Then, the specialized subjects would vary. For example, students aiming for medical schools would have more biology and chemistry, while engineering students might have more physics and math.

I should also check if there are any recent changes. But since I don't have access to current data, I'll stick to the general knowledge I have. The answer should list the subjects required, probably grouped into general and specialized categories. However, the user asked for a list form in JSON, so maybe each subject is listed individually. Wait, the user's example shows a list of strings, so each subject as a separate item. But I need to confirm if the required subjects are a set of general ones plus the specialized ones. 

Alternatively, maybe the required subjects are divided into different tracks. For example, the Konkur has three main tracks: humanities (Arts), sciences (Natural Sciences), and technical (Engineering, etc.). Each track has its own set of subjects. But the question is about the required subjects in the entrance exam, so perhaps the answer should list all the subjects that are part of the exam, regardless of the track. 

Wait, the user might be looking for the core subjects that are common across all tracks, plus the specialized ones. But I need to be precise. From my understanding, the Konkur consists of several sections: Persian language and literature, Islamic studies, general knowledge, and then specialized subjects based on the",1,,,,1,1.0

New-pe-86,What is the name of the most famous tower in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the name of the most famous tower in Iran. First, I need to recall or research which towers are prominent in Iran.

I know that Iran has several historical towers, but the most famous one is likely the Arg-e Bam. Wait, no, Arg-e Bam is a fortress, not a tower. Maybe the Tower of Silence? No, that's in India, I think. Wait, Iran has the Tomb of Hafez, but that's a mausoleum. 

Wait, there's the Shah Mosque in Isfahan, but that's a mosque with minarets. Maybe the Minaret of Samarra? No, that's in Iraq. Hmm. Let me think again. Oh, the most famous tower might be the Arg-e Karim Khan in Shiraz. But I'm not sure if that's the most famous. Alternatively, the Tower of the Seven Domes in Isfahan? No, that's the Shah Mosque again. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a ziggurat? The ancient ziggurat of Chogha Zanbil is in Iran, but that's more of a ziggurat than a tower. Alternatively, the Eram Garden has some structures, but not towers. 

Wait, I think I might be confusing some names. Let me check my memory. The most famous tower in Iran is actually the Arg-e Bam, but I thought that was a fortress. Alternatively, the tower of the mausoleum of Shah Abbas in Isfahan? No, that's the Shah Mosque again. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the Tower of Silence, but that's in India. Maybe the user is thinking of the Ali Qapu Palace in Isfahan, which has a tower. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the most famous tower might be the one in the city of Yazd, like the Yazd towers, which are historical towers. 

Wait, the Yazd towers, such as the Badgir (windcatcher), but those are more like towers for cooling. However, the most famous might be the Arg-e Yazd. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the Tower of the Shah in Tehran, like the Shahyad Tower, which is part of the Azadi Tower. Yes! The Azadi Tower in Tehran is a prominent landmark. It's also known as the Shahyad Tower",1,,,,1,0.4
Th-en-53,What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian schools and their activities.

First, Iran has a strong cultural emphasis on education, and schools often have various clubs and events. However, due to cultural and religious norms, some activities might be restricted. For example, sports like football (soccer) are popular, but I'm not sure if that's considered an extracurricular social event or more of a sport.

Then there's the possibility of cultural events. Maybe poetry recitation or traditional music? But I'm not certain if those are the most popular. Another angle is looking at events that involve the whole school community. In some countries, proms or dances are common, but in Iran, such events might not be allowed due to modesty laws.

Wait, I remember reading that in some Iranian schools, especially in cities, cultural festivals or talent shows are organized. These could include performances, art exhibitions, or competitions. Alternatively, religious events like Quran recitation competitions might be popular, but those might be more academic or religious rather than social.

Another thought: school plays or drama clubs. However, with the conservative values, producing plays might be limited. Maybe sports events like inter-school competitions? But again, that's more sports-related.

Alternatively, maybe the most popular is something like the ""school festival"" which includes various activities like games, food stalls, and performances. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Iran.

Wait, I should check if there's any specific event that's widely recognized. I recall that in some contexts, ""school cultural days"" or ""science fairs"" are common, but again, not sure about popularity.

Alternatively, maybe the most common is the ""sports day"" or ""sports festival"" where students participate in various athletic events. However, I'm not certain if that's the most social or if it's more competitive.

Alternatively, considering the restrictions on certain activities, perhaps the most popular social events are those that are allowed, like poetry recitation contests, which are culturally significant and might be encouraged in schools.

But I need to be careful here. Maybe the answer is that the most popular is the ""school cultural festival"" or ""cultural day"" events. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is looking at the internet or sources. But since I can't access current data, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

New-en-41,Who is the most well known and successful entrepreneur in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most well-known and successful entrepreneur in Iran is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian entrepreneurs. I know that Iran has a variety of industries, including technology, manufacturing, and agriculture. 

First, I should think of any prominent business figures. There's the name of Masoud Khosravi, but I'm not sure if he's the most successful. Then there's the company Saba, which is a major software company in Iran. But I'm not certain if the founder is the most well-known.

Another name that comes to mind is the founder of Digikala, which is an e-commerce platform in Iran. I think the founder is Ali Khatami. Digikala has grown quite a bit and is one of the largest online marketplaces in the country. That might make him a top candidate.

Also, there's the automobile industry in Iran. Companies like Saipa and Iran Khodro are significant. The founders or CEOs of these companies might be considered, but I'm not sure about their prominence compared to tech entrepreneurs.

In the tech sector, there's also the name of Behzad Soltani, who is associated with Simya, a company that deals with digital services. However, I'm not sure about his ranking.

Another angle is looking at billionaires. According to some reports, the richest people in Iran include those in the energy and construction sectors. For example, the family of Fereydoun Davari, who is involved in construction and real estate. But is he considered an entrepreneur or more of a businessman?

Then there's the name of Amirhossein Zare, the founder of Snapp, which is a ride-hailing and food delivery app. Snapp has been quite successful, especially in the context of sanctions affecting Iranian tech companies. That might make him a strong contender.

Wait, but I need to verify which of these individuals is the most well-known. Digikala's Ali Khatami is definitely a big name in e-commerce. However, there's also the founder of Saman, which is a major IT services company. The founder there might be another name.

Alternatively, looking at the automotive industry, the CEO of Iran Khodro, but I'm not sure about their current status or if they're considered entrepreneurs.

Okay, so the user is asking about the typical probation period for new employees in Iran before signing a formal contract. Let me start by recalling what I know about labor laws in Iran.

First, I remember that Iran has specific labor laws governed by the Labor Law of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Probation periods are part of employment contracts, but I need to check the exact duration. From what I've studied, the probation period is usually set by the employer and the employee, but there might be legal limits.

Wait, I think the Labor Law allows a probation period of up to 6 months. However, this might vary depending on the type of job or the industry. For example, some sources mention that for certain positions, the probation period could be shorter. But the maximum allowed by law is 6 months. However, I should confirm if there's a standard typical period that's commonly used, like 1-3 months, even if the law allows longer.

Also, there's a possibility that the probation period isn't explicitly mentioned in the law but is negotiated between employer and employee. But since the question is about the typical period, maybe the common practice is around 1-3 months. However, I need to be careful not to mix up the legal maximum with common practice.

Wait, another angle: in some cases, the probation period might be part of the initial contract, and after that, the formal contract is signed. So maybe the probation period is considered part of the trial period before the main contract. But in Iran, the employment contract itself might include the probation period. I need to check if there's a standard duration that's widely accepted.

Looking up some references, I find that according to Iranian labor law, the probation period can be up to 6 months. However, in practice, employers often set it to 1-3 months. But since the user is asking for the typical probation period, which might be the common practice rather than the legal maximum. However, without specific data, I should state the legal maximum as the answer, but I need to make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no fixed period, but it's agreed upon by both parties, with a maximum of 6 months. However, the question is about the typical period, so maybe the answer is 1-3 months. But I need to be precise.

Wait, I think the correct answer is that the probation period can be up to 6 months as per the law, but the typical",1,,,,1,1.0

Jod-ch-01,What eating utensils do people commonly used in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what eating utensils are commonly used in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian dining customs. I remember that in many Middle Eastern countries, people use their hands for eating, especially with certain dishes like rice or bread. But I also know that utensils like forks and knives are used too, especially in more formal settings or when eating specific foods.

Wait, but Iran has a mix of traditional and modern practices. Maybe they use both hands and utensils. Let me think about specific dishes. For example, when eating rice dishes like chelow, people often use a knife and fork, especially in restaurants. But for things like flatbreads, like lavash or sangak, they might use their hands to tear the bread and eat with it. Also, there's the use of spoons for soups or stews. 

I should also consider if there are any traditional utensils unique to Iran. Maybe the ""chopsticks"" but I don't think they're common there. More likely, the standard fork, knife, and spoon. However, in some cases, people might use a knife to cut meat and then eat with their hands, especially if the meat is served in pieces. 

Another point: in formal dining, especially in cities, utensils are more common. In rural areas or during informal meals, hands might be more prevalent. But the question is about what's commonly used, so probably a combination. However, the answer needs to be a list of utensils. So maybe the primary ones are fork, knife, spoon, and hands. But I should check if there's any other specific tool. Maybe the ""kabab"" is eaten with hands, but that's more about the food than the utensil. 

Wait, the user wants the answer as a list in JSON. The example shows ""answer here"" as a list. So I need to list the utensils. So the answer would include fork, knife, spoon, and hands. But I need to confirm if hands are considered utensils here. The question says ""eating utensils,"" and hands are technically not utensils, but in some contexts, they are used. However, maybe the answer should include them as part of the common practices. Alternatively, maybe the answer focuses on actual utensils like fork, knife, spoon, and maybe a spoon for soups.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking what type of alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Iran. Hmm, first I need to recall what I know about Iranian culture and alcohol consumption.

I remember that Iran has strict laws against alcohol. The country is predominantly Muslim, and Islam prohibits the consumption of alcohol. So, in public settings, especially during festivals, would people consume alcohol? Wait, but maybe there are exceptions or traditional drinks that are allowed?

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. In Iran, the production and sale of alcohol are illegal, but I've heard that some people might consume it in private settings. However, during festivals, even more so, it's probably not common. But the question is about festivals, so maybe there are traditional non-alcoholic drinks that are popular?

Alternatively, perhaps the user is thinking of a specific drink that's sometimes consumed despite the laws. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Are there any alcoholic beverages that are culturally significant in Iran? Maybe something like arak or other spirits, but I don't think they are commonly consumed publicly.

Wait, but the question is about festivals. Maybe the answer is that no alcoholic drinks are consumed, but the user is expecting a type of drink. However, given the legal restrictions, it's possible that the answer is that alcoholic drinks are not commonly consumed, but the question might be expecting a different answer. Maybe the user is mistaken, but as an AI, I need to provide accurate information.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question. Maybe the user is referring to a different country, but the question specifically says Iran. So, considering all that, the most accurate answer would be that alcoholic drinks are not commonly consumed at festivals in Iran due to legal and cultural restrictions. However, the user wants a single answer in a list. But the options might not include that. Wait, the user's instruction says to provide the answer as a list in JSON. But if the answer is that there's no common alcoholic drink, how to phrase that?

Wait, maybe the answer is that no alcoholic drinks are consumed, but the user might be expecting a specific type. Alternatively, perhaps there's a traditional drink that's sometimes consumed, but I can't think of any. Maybe the user is confused because in some regions, people might have different practices, but legally, it's prohibited. So the safest answer is that alcoholic drinks are not commonly consumed at festivals in Iran. But the user wants a type of",1,,,,1,0.5

New-gr-06,What is the most popular food in Iran among young people?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular food in Iran is among young people. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian cuisine. Traditional dishes like kebabs, rice, and stews are common, but the question is about young people's preferences.

Maybe I should consider trends. Younger generations might be influenced by global food trends or health consciousness. For example, there's been a rise in plant-based diets or fusion foods. However, Iran has its own street foods that are popular, like shish kebab or falafel. Wait, falafel is more Middle Eastern, but in Iran, they have their version called ""falafel"" too, made from lentils or chickpeas.

Another angle: fast food. Chains like KFC or McDonald's might have a presence, but I'm not sure if they're the most popular. Alternatively, local fast food options like ""Shish kebab"" or ""Chelow kebab"" could be more favored. Also, there's the popularity of snacks like ""ghormeh sabzi"" (a herb stew) or ""fesenj캐n"" (a walnut and pomegranate stew), but those are more traditional.

Wait, maybe looking at social media trends. Young people might be into trendy cafes or bakeries. For example, ""khubz"" (flatbread) with various toppings, or maybe desserts like baklava. However, I'm not certain if these are the most popular.

Alternatively, considering health trends, maybe salads or grilled foods are more in vogue. Or perhaps the popularity of ""soups"" like ""ash reshteh"" (a noodle soup), but again, that's traditional.

Another thought: Iran has a growing coffee culture, with young people preferring coffee shops. But that's a beverage, not food. Maybe ""shakarpareh"" (a sweet pastry) is popular among younger people?

Wait, I think I've read that kebab, specifically ""shish kebab"" or ""koobideh"" (minced meat kebab), is still very popular among all age groups, including young people. However, maybe there's a shift towards more modern or fusion dishes. But without specific data, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe ""pizza"" has become popular due to global influence, but I'm not sure if it's the most popular. Or perhaps ""falafel"" as a vegetarian option is gaining traction among younger",1,,,,1,1.0
New-su-34,What is the most popular extracurricular activity related to music in schools in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most popular extracurricular music activity in Iranian schools. Let me think. I know that in Iran, music education is part of the school curriculum, but there might be specific extracurricular activities that are more popular.

First, I should consider the cultural context. Iran has a rich musical tradition, including both traditional and modern music. However, due to religious regulations, certain types of music might be restricted. Extracurricular activities might focus on traditional instruments or vocal music.

I recall that in some schools, music clubs or choirs might be common. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular. Another possibility is instrument ensembles, like bands or orchestras. However, given the cultural norms, maybe it's more about traditional music groups, such as those playing instruments like the tar, setar, or daf.

Wait, there's also the possibility of religious music, like reciting poetry or performing in a style that's acceptable under Islamic law. But would that be considered an extracurricular activity? Or maybe it's part of the curriculum.

Alternatively, considering the availability of resources, school choirs might be more common than instrumental ensembles. But I need to verify if there's a specific activity that's widely recognized as the most popular.

Another angle: looking at government policies. The Iranian government has supported music education, especially in schools, but with certain restrictions. Extracurricular activities might include music competitions, festivals, or participation in cultural events. However, the question is about the activity itself, not events.

Wait, maybe the answer is ""school choirs"" or ""music clubs."" But I need to be precise. I think in many Iranian schools, music ensembles or choirs are the primary extracurricular activities related to music. However, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, it could be instrumental groups focusing on traditional instruments.

But I should check if there's a consensus or data on this. Since I can't access current data, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. In many countries, school bands or choirs are common, so maybe Iran is similar. However, considering the cultural aspects, it's possible that traditional music groups are more prominent.

Wait, but the question is about the most popular. If I'm unsure between choirs and traditional ensembles, maybe the answer is school choirs. Alternatively, maybe it's music competitions or festivals, but those are events, not activities.

Ji-ko-26,What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Iran's society?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the key milestones for children's independence in Iran. First, I need to recall what I know about Iranian society and cultural norms regarding children growing up and becoming independent.

I remember that in many Middle Eastern countries, family structures are often close-knit, and children might stay with their parents longer. But I need to focus specifically on Iran. Let me think about the typical stages. 

Education is probably a big one. In Iran, girls typically start their education earlier, and there's a strong emphasis on education. So maybe completing secondary education is a milestone. Then, higher education, like university, might be another step because it's a significant commitment and often requires living away from home for the first time.

Marriage is another key aspect. In many cultures, including Iran, marriage is seen as a major step towards independence. So getting married and starting a family would be a milestone. But I should check if there are age differences or societal expectations around that.

Financial independence is important too. When children start working or managing their own finances, that's a step towards independence. However, in Iran, maybe the transition is gradual. Also, moving out of the family home is a clear milestone, but I'm not sure if that's common or if many stay with parents longer.

Legal adulthood is another point. In Iran, the age of majority is 18, so turning 18 might be a legal milestone. However, socially, they might not be considered independent until later. Also, military service for men is mandatory, which could be a significant event in their lives, but is that considered a milestone towards independence? Maybe not directly, but it's a major life event.

Employment and starting a career would be important. Once they have a job and can support themselves, that's a key step. Also, taking on responsibilities like managing personal affairs, making decisions without parental input, and living independently.

I need to make sure these points are specific to Iran's context. For example, the role of religion and cultural norms might influence these milestones. In Iran, the family is very important, so maybe the transition is slower compared to Western countries. Also, gender roles might affect the milestones. For example, women might have different expectations compared to men in terms of education and employment.

Wait, the question doesn't specify gender, so I should keep it general. Let me list possible milestones again:

1. Completion of secondary education (high school).
2. Higher education (university).",1,,,,,

Th-en-37,"At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Iran? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about when children in Iran typically become independent from their parents. First, I need to recall what I know about Iranian culture and societal norms regarding children's independence.

I remember that in many Middle Eastern countries, including Iran, there's a strong emphasis on family ties and respect for parents. Children often live with their parents until they get married, which is a significant event. So maybe the age when they become independent is around when they get married, which is usually in the late teens or early twenties.

But wait, I should check if there are any cultural or legal factors that influence this. In Iran, the legal age for marriage is 13 for girls and 15 for boys, but in practice, people often marry later, maybe around 18-20. However, even after marriage, the couple might live with the parents for a while, especially if they're starting a new life together. So maybe the age when they're considered independent is when they get married, but that might vary.

I've also heard that in some cases, especially in urban areas, young adults might move out after finishing their education, which in Iran is typically around 18-22. So maybe around 18-20? But I'm not sure if that's when they become fully independent or if they still rely on parents financially.

Another angle: in many countries, becoming independent might mean leaving home, having a job, and managing their own finances. In Iran, after university, which is around 22, some might start working and move out. However, cultural expectations might keep them living with parents longer, even if they're working. So perhaps the typical age is 22, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I should verify if there's a standard age. Maybe in Iran, the average age when children leave home is around 20-22. But I'm not finding exact statistics here. Since the question asks for an answer in Arabic numerals, maybe the common answer is 22? Or maybe 18? But I think the general trend in many parts of the world is that people leave home in their late teens to early twenties. Given Iran's cultural context, it might be similar. So I'll go with 22 as a probable answer, but I need to be cautious. Alternatively, maybe it's when they get married, which could be 18-20. Hmm. Maybe the answer is",1,,,,0,0

Al-en-01,What is a common snack for preschool kids in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out a common snack for preschool kids in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian cuisine and snacks. Iran has a variety of traditional foods, but when it comes to snacks for children, they might have something that's both nutritious and familiar.

I remember that in many Middle Eastern countries, dates are a common snack. They are natural, sweet, and easy for kids to eat. Also, maybe something like cookies or pastries. But I need to be specific. Another thought is that Iranians often have snacks like ""shirini"" which are sweet pastries, but I'm not sure if those are typical for preschoolers.

Wait, there's also ""kale pacheh"" which is a soup, but that's more of a meal. Maybe something like ""ghormeh sabzi"" but that's also a main dish. For snacks, perhaps ""biscotti"" or ""bademjan"" (eggplant-based snacks)? No, maybe not. 

I think ""faloodeh"" is a dessert, but that's more of a treat. Another possibility is ""sholeh zard,"" but that's a sweet rice pudding, maybe not a snack. Let me think about common snacks that are simple. Maybe ""sabzi"" (herbs) with yogurt? But that's more of a side dish. 

Wait, I've heard of ""kuku"" which is a frittata-like dish, but again, not sure if it's a snack. Alternatively, ""shirin polo"" is sweet rice, but again, not a snack. 

Wait, maybe ""baghali"" which is a type of green bean and dill dish, but that's a main course. 

Alternatively, thinking about Western influences, maybe cookies or chocolate bars. But I need to be more precise. 

Another angle: in Iran, it's common to have snacks like ""nokhodchi"" (chickpea flour cookies) or ""shirin pacheh"" (sweet lamb), but those might be too rich for kids. 

Wait, maybe ""kaleh"" which is a type of date. Dates are commonly given as snacks, especially in the Middle East. They are healthy, natural, and easy for children. I think that's a good bet. 

Alternatively, ""kashk"" is a type of yogurt, but that's more of a drink.

Al-en-32,What is the main dish for Thanksgiving in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the main dish for Thanksgiving in Iran. Let me think. First, I need to recall if Thanksgiving is celebrated in Iran. Thanksgiving is primarily a US holiday, but some countries might have similar festivals or might adopt it. However, Iran is a Muslim country, and their major holidays are Islamic ones like Nowruz, which is their New Year. Nowruz is celebrated on the spring equinox, usually around March 20th.

Now, the user is asking specifically about Thanksgiving in Iran. Maybe some Iranians in the diaspora might celebrate Thanksgiving, but in Iran itself, it's not a traditional holiday. So, the main dish for Thanksgiving in Iran would be the same as in the US, which is turkey. But wait, maybe there's a local twist? However, since Thanksgiving isn't a traditional Iranian holiday, there might not be a specific main dish associated with it there. Alternatively, if they do celebrate it, they might still have turkey as the main dish, similar to the US. But I need to confirm if there's any local dish that's commonly associated with Thanksgiving in Iran. I don't think so. So the answer is probably that there isn't a main dish because Thanksgiving isn't celebrated there, but if they do, it's turkey. However, the user might be expecting that since Thanksgiving isn't observed in Iran, there's no main dish. But the question is phrased as if there is one. Maybe the user is confused, thinking that Iran has a similar holiday. Alternatively, maybe they're referring to Nowruz, which is a major holiday in Iran. The main dish for Nowruz is usually fish, especially sabzi polo ba mahi (herbed rice with fish). But the question specifically says Thanksgiving, not Nowruz. So I need to be careful here. The answer is that Thanksgiving is not a traditional holiday in Iran, so there isn't a main dish associated with it. But the user wants the answer in a list form. So the answer would be that there is no main dish for Thanksgiving in Iran because it's not a traditional holiday there. However, if they do celebrate it, they might follow the US tradition of turkey. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken and meant Nowruz. But the question is about Thanksgiving. So the safest answer is that there is no main dish for Thanksgiving in Iran, as the holiday is not observed there. Therefore, the answer should be an",1,,,,,

An-ar-03,Which month is the final exam term usually scheduled at high schools in Iran? (Provide Arabic numerals (1~12) only.),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which month the final exams are usually scheduled in high schools in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Iranian education system.

First, the school year in Iran typically starts in late August or early September. That's because the new academic year often begins around the first day of the Persian month of Mordad, which is roughly August. So, if the school year starts in September, then the final exams would be towards the end of the academic year.

Now, the academic year in many countries, including Iran, is divided into two semesters. The first semester might end around mid-December, and then there's a winter break. The second semester would start again in January or February. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact timing here. However, final exams for the entire year are usually at the end of the second semester.

In many countries, final exams are held in June or July. But since Iran's school year starts in September, adding about nine months would bring us to June. Wait, but if the school year starts in September, then the end would be around May or June. However, I've heard that in Iran, the final exams for high school are in the month of May. Let me check that again.

Alternatively, maybe the school year is from September to June. So, the final exams would be in June. But I need to confirm. Also, considering the Islamic calendar, which is lunar, but the school system might follow the solar calendar. Let me think. In Iran, the academic calendar is based on the solar calendar. The school year starts in the first week of September and ends in the last week of June. So the final exams would be in June, which is month 6. But wait, sometimes there might be a break in March or April, but the final exams are likely in June. However, I'm not 100% certain. Let me try to recall if there are any specific events. For example, the Iranian high school final exams, known as ""Konkur,"" are usually held in the month of May. Wait, Konkur is the university entrance exam, which is taken by high school graduates. But the final exams for the school year might be different. Maybe the school's final exams are in May, and then the Konkur is in May as well. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the school year ends in June, so the final exams are in June",1,,,,0,0
Ji-ko-28,When is the first day that people celebrate after a child is born in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out when the first day of celebration is after a child is born in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian customs and holidays. 

First, I know that in many cultures, there are specific days or events that mark the birth of a child. For example, in some places, the 40th day after birth is significant, like in some Christian traditions. But I'm not sure about Iran specifically.

I remember that in Iran, there's a tradition called ""Chaharshanbe Suri"" which is related to Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Nowruz is celebrated on the僚봰갡, which is around March 20th or 21st. But how does that relate to a newborn?

Wait, maybe there's a specific day after the birth. Let me think. I think in Iran, the 40th day after the birth is celebrated. This might be similar to the 40-day tradition in other cultures, like the Christian ""Forty Days"" celebration. But is that the first day they celebrate?

Alternatively, maybe the first celebration is on the baby's first birthday, but that seems less likely. Another possibility is the 10th day, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, I should verify. I recall that in Iran, the 40th day is called ""Sorush"" or ""Chaharshanbe Suri."" But I need to check if that's the first celebration. However, I think the first celebration might be the 40th day. Let me confirm. 

Alternatively, maybe the first day is the day of birth, but that's the actual birth, not a celebration. The question is about the first day people celebrate after the birth. So perhaps the 40th day is the answer. But I'm not 100% certain. Maybe there's another day. 

Another angle: Nowruz is a big holiday, but it's not directly tied to a child's birth. However, if a child is born around Nowruz, maybe there's a celebration, but that's not specific. 

I think the key here is the 40th day. Let me check my memory again. Yes, I believe in Iran, the 40th day after the birth is a significant day where family and friends gather to celebrate, give gifts, and have a feast. This is similar to the 40-day celebration in some other",1,,,,,

Ne-ar-06,What do people from Iran eat in Ramadan?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people in Iran eat during Ramadan. Let me start by recalling that Ramadan is the Islamic holy month of fasting from dawn to sunset. So, during this time, Muslims in Iran, like elsewhere, would have specific meals to break their fast and prepare for the next day.

First, I remember that the main meals are iftar (the evening meal to break the fast) and suhoor (the pre-dawn meal). For iftar, common foods might include dates, which are traditional because the Prophet Muhammad is said to have broken his fast with dates. Then there's probably bread, maybe flatbreads like lavash or sangak. Also, soups are common, such as lentil soup or tomato soup. Maybe some rice dishes, like tahdig or chelow. For suhoor, they might eat more substantial foods to last through the day, like eggs, dairy products, fruits, and maybe some proteins like chicken or legumes.

I should also consider traditional Iranian dishes that are popular during Ramadan. Dishes like fesenj캐n (a walnut and pomegranate stew) or gheimeh (a lentil and meat stew) might be part of the meals. Also, sweets like baklava or halva could be eaten, especially during iftar. However, I need to make sure these are actually consumed during Ramadan or if they are more general. Also, considering the time of day, maybe more light meals during the day, but since they fast, they'd eat suhoor and iftar.

Wait, but the question is about what they eat in Ramadan, not just the specific meals. So the answer should include the main dishes for iftar and suhoor, as well as any other traditional foods. Also, maybe mention that they avoid eating during daylight hours, but the question is about what they eat, not the fasting itself.

I need to make sure the list is accurate. Let me check if I'm missing any key components. Dates, bread, soups, rice dishes, stews, sweets. Also, maybe dairy products like yogurt or cheese for suhoor. Also, fruits and vegetables for suhoor to stay hydrated. But I should avoid including non-food items. Also, maybe mention that meals are often shared with family and friends, but the question is about the food itself.

So, compiling all that, the answer should be a list of typical foods consumed during Ramadan in Iran, focusing on iftar",1,,,,1,0.3333333333333333

Al-en-39,What do people eat on their birthday in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people eat on their birthday in Iran. Let me start by recalling any information I have about Iranian cuisine and traditions. I know that in many cultures, birthdays are celebrated with specific foods, often symbolic or traditional dishes.

First, I remember that in Iran, there's a tradition called ""Sizdah Bedar"" which is on the 13th day of the Nowruz holiday, but that's not a birthday. However, maybe some elements of Nowruz are incorporated into birthday celebrations? Nowruz involves eating specific foods like sabzi (herbs), samanu (a sweet paste), and reshteh (noodles). But I'm not sure if those are directly used for birthdays.

Then, thinking about common Iranian dishes, there's khoresh (stews), which are popular. Maybe something like khoresh fesenj캐n (pomegranate and walnut stew) or khoresh gheimeh (lentil stew). Also, rice dishes like chelow are common. For birthdays, maybe they have a special meal with family, including these dishes.

Another thought: in some cultures, people eat cake on birthdays, but I don't know if that's the case in Iran. Maybe they have a different dessert. Also, there's a dish called ""sholeh zard,"" which is a sweet rice pudding with saffron and orange blossom water. That might be a possibility for a birthday dessert.

I should also consider if there are any specific birthday cakes or pastries in Iran. Maybe they make a type of cake similar to other Middle Eastern countries, like baklava or something else. Alternatively, they might have a traditional dessert that's served on special occasions.

Wait, I think in Iran, for birthdays, people might eat a cake, but it's not as common as in Western countries. Instead, they might have traditional dishes that are prepared for celebrations. For example, ""kuku"" (a type of frittata) or ""tahdig"" (crispy rice at the bottom of the pot). Also, ""ghormeh sabzi"" (a herb and bean stew) is popular, but I don't know if it's specifically for birthdays.

Another angle: looking up if there are any specific birthday foods. Wait, I can't actually look it up, but from what I remember, Iranians might have a special meal that includes a variety of dishes, such as stews, rice, and desserts.",1,,,,1,1.0

Th-en-51,Which subject is considered the most important for students in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which subject is considered the most important for students in Iran. Let me start by thinking about the education system there. Iran has a strong emphasis on certain subjects, especially in their curriculum.

First, I remember that in many countries, subjects like math, science, and literature are core. But in Iran, there might be a particular focus due to cultural or governmental priorities. The Iranian education system is known for being rigorous, especially in STEM fields. However, I also recall that the national exams, like the Konkur, are highly competitive, and students often focus on subjects that are crucial for university admissions.

Religion is a big part of Iranian culture, so maybe Islamic studies or religious education is important. But the question is about the most important subject for students, which might relate to their academic success rather than just cultural aspects. 

Another angle: the government's emphasis on certain fields. For example, there's been a push for technological advancement and engineering, so maybe subjects like physics, math, or engineering are prioritized. However, in the context of the Konkur, students often choose majors that are more competitive and have better job prospects. 

Wait, but the question isn't about the most popular or competitive major, but the most important subject. In Iran, the core subjects in the curriculum include mathematics, physics, chemistry, and literature. However, Islamic studies are also a mandatory part of the curriculum. But if I think about the subjects that have the highest weightage in the national exams, mathematics and science subjects might be more critical for university admissions. 

However, there's also the aspect of the humanities. For example, Arabic language is taught as a compulsory subject, but is that considered the most important? Or maybe Persian literature? 

Wait, I should check if there's any official data or sources that indicate this. From what I know, in the Iranian education system, mathematics is often a key subject because it's required for many university programs and is heavily tested. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the government might emphasize Islamic studies as the most important, but that's more of a cultural or religious aspect rather than an academic subject. 

Another thought: in the context of the Konkur, students have to take exams in various subjects, and the scores determine their university placement. The subjects with the highest scores might be considered more important. However, the most important subject could be the one that's most emphasized in the curriculum and required for higher education.

Okay, so the user is asking about the typical food items that people in Iran pair with hard liquor. Hmm, first, I need to recall what I know about Iranian cuisine and drinking habits. Wait, but I should be careful here. Iran has strict laws against alcohol consumption, right? So, is hard liquor even commonly consumed there? Maybe in some private settings or among certain groups?

But the question is about what's typically paired with hard liquor. If it's not common, maybe the answer is that there aren't traditional pairings because alcohol isn't part of the culture. However, maybe there are some dishes that are eaten when people do consume alcohol, even if it's not traditional.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to similar practices in neighboring countries or regions with similar cuisines. But the question specifically mentions Iran. I need to be accurate here.

I should check if there are any traditional Iranian dishes that are commonly associated with alcohol consumption. For example, in some Middle Eastern countries, mezze or appetizers like hummus, falafel, or grilled meats might be served with drinks. But in Iran, since alcohol is prohibited, maybe people don't have traditional pairings. However, if someone is consuming hard liquor in secret, they might pair it with common snacks or dishes.

Another angle: maybe the user is confused because they think Iran has a culture of drinking, but in reality, it's illegal. So the answer might be that there are no traditional food pairings because alcohol consumption is not part of the cultural norm. But the question is about what people do pair, not about the legality.

Alternatively, maybe there are some dishes that are consumed alongside alcohol in certain contexts, even if it's not widespread. For example, in some regions, people might eat nuts, cheese, or bread with alcohol. But I'm not sure if that's specific to Iran.

Wait, I should make sure not to assume. Since the user is asking for a list, perhaps the answer is that there are no traditional pairings due to the prohibition, but maybe some people might pair it with common snacks. However, I need to be cautious not to provide incorrect information. Maybe the safest answer is that there are no traditional food items paired with hard liquor in Iran due to legal restrictions, but if forced to list, perhaps common snacks like nuts or bread. However, I need to verify this.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the time when alcohol was more common before the Islamic Revolution. But even then, it",1,,,,,
New-en-68,What repercussions are there for bad behavior in schools in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the repercussions for bad behavior in schools in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian education system and discipline policies. I remember that Iran has a strict educational system influenced by Islamic values. So, punishments are likely to be severe and rooted in religious principles.

First, I should consider common disciplinary actions in schools. In many countries, bad behavior might lead to detention, suspension, or expulsion. But in Iran, especially with the influence of the Islamic regime, there might be more severe consequences. Maybe corporal punishment is still used? I think some sources mention that schools in Iran might use physical punishment like caning or other forms of corporal discipline for misbehavior.

Another angle is the involvement of religious authorities. If a student's behavior is considered against Islamic norms, there could be involvement from the religious police or other moral authorities. This might lead to more severe penalties beyond just school discipline.

Also, there might be social repercussions. Students who misbehave could face stigma or ostracism from peers and the community. Additionally, parents might be involved, and there could be pressure on the family to discipline the child more strictly.

I should also think about legal consequences. If the bad behavior escalates to something like vandalism, assault, or other crimes, the student might face legal action. However, for typical school misconduct, legal repercussions might not be common unless it's a serious offense.

Another point is the role of the school's religious teachers or counselors. They might impose penalties based on Islamic teachings, such as fasting, prayers, or other religious penances. Also, expulsion from school is a possibility for severe cases.

Wait, but I need to make sure these are accurate. I should check if corporal punishment is still legally allowed in Iran's schools. From what I recall, Iran has laws against corporal punishment in some contexts, but in practice, especially in religious schools, it might still be used. However, I need to be cautious here to avoid misinformation.

Alternatively, maybe the repercussions are more about moral education and rehabilitation rather than punishment. But given the strict societal norms, punishment is likely.

Putting it all together, the repercussions could include detention, suspension, expulsion, corporal punishment, involvement of religious authorities, social stigma, and possible legal action for serious offenses. However, I need to ensure that these are the actual repercussions and not just assumptions. Since I can't look it up, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I think the key points are corporal punishment",1,,,,1,1.0

Ca-sp-41,Where do the dependent elderly usually live in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking where dependent elderly people usually live in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about elderly care in Iran.

First, I know that in many countries, elderly care can be provided in various settings like homes, nursing homes, or community centers. But in Iran, cultural and social factors might influence this. Iran has a strong family-oriented culture, so maybe many elderly live with their families. However, there might be cases where they can't live at home due to lack of support or resources.

I should check if there are specific institutions in Iran for elderly care. I remember that there are some government-run homes or centers for the elderly, especially for those who are poor or have no family. Also, some NGOs might run facilities. But are these common? Or is the majority still living with family?

Another angle: in rural areas, maybe extended family is more common, while in cities, there might be more institutional care. But I'm not sure about the prevalence. Also, considering economic factors, not all families can afford to care for elderly relatives, leading some to rely on state or charitable institutions.

I need to make sure the answer is accurate. So, the primary answer would be that dependent elderly in Iran usually live with their families. However, those who can't live with family might reside in state-run elderly homes or community centers. But the question asks for where they ""usually"" live, so the main answer is family homes. However, I should confirm if there's a significant number in institutions. Maybe the answer includes both family and institutional settings, but the primary is family. Wait, the user might want the most common place. Let me verify.

Looking up some sources (even though I can't access the internet, I have prior knowledge). In Iran, traditional family structures are strong, so many elderly live with their children. However, due to urbanization and changing family dynamics, some elderly might live alone or in facilities. But the majority would be in family homes. So the answer is that dependent elderly usually live with their families. However, the question might be expecting both family and institutional settings. Wait, the user's example answer format is a list, so maybe both points are needed. Let me think again.

The question is about ""dependent"" elderly, which implies they need care. If they are dependent, they might require more assistance, so maybe some live in institutions. But in many cases, especially in a culture that emphasizes family care, they would be with family.",1,,,,1,1.0

Gu-ch-08,What is the most popular sports among children in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular sports among children in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Iran. Iran has a strong cultural emphasis on certain sports, especially those that are traditional or have religious significance. For example, I remember that wrestling, particularly Freestyle wrestling, is quite popular there. It's even been a successful sport for Iranian athletes in international competitions.

Then there's football (soccer), which is a global phenomenon and probably popular in Iran too. I think Iran has a good football league and the national team is well-known. Kids might play football in parks or streets, which is common in many countries.

Another sport that comes to mind is weightlifting. Iran has produced several Olympic champions in weightlifting, so that might be a popular sport among children as well, especially in areas where strength training is encouraged from a young age.

I should also consider other sports. Maybe volleyball or basketball? But I'm not sure about their popularity compared to wrestling and football. Also, there's the possibility of traditional sports like taekwondo or judo, but I think wrestling is more prominent.

Wait, I should check if there are any cultural factors. Since Iran is a Muslim country, some sports might be more encouraged than others. For instance, sports that don't involve mixed genders might be more prevalent. Football is played by both genders, but maybe in a way that's separated. Wrestling is a male-dominated sport, so that might be more popular among boys.

Also, I remember that the Iranian government has supported certain sports, and wrestling is one of them. They have a lot of wrestling schools and competitions. So that's a good point.

Putting it all together, the top sports for children would likely be wrestling, football, and weightlifting. But I need to confirm if these are indeed the most popular. Maybe I should think about participation rates. If kids play football in streets and have local leagues, that's a big indicator. Wrestling might be more organized with training centers. Weightlifting is also organized, but maybe not as common for children as the first two.

Another angle: looking at international events. Iran's success in wrestling at the Olympics and World Championships could inspire children to take it up. Football is also a big part of the national identity, so that's a strong contender.

I think I can safely list wrestling, football, and weightlifting as the top three. But the question is about the most popular, so maybe the answer is wrestling? Or maybe the",1,,,,1,1.0

New-spme-05,What are the most popular sweets in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular sweets in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian cuisine. I remember that there are a lot of traditional sweets, often made with ingredients like rose water, saffron, and nuts. 

First, there's something called ""Sholeh Zard."" I think that's a sweet rice pudding, maybe with sugar and rose water. Then there's ""Faloodeh,"" which I believe is a frozen dessert made with vermicelli and syrup. Another one might be ""Baklava,"" but I'm not sure if that's as popular in Iran as in other Middle Eastern countries. Wait, maybe ""Kashkadeh"" is another one? It's a type of sweet soup with noodles and sugar.

Oh, and ""Gaz"" comes to mind. That's a type of brittle made with sugar, almonds, and sometimes rose water. Then there's ""Shirini,"" which is a general term for sweets, but specific types include ""Shirini Bastani"" (like a kind of cookie) and ""Shirini Kourma"" which might be a date-based sweet. 

Wait, I should check if ""Shirini"" is a category or specific items. Also, ""Tahdig"" is more of a side dish, not a sweet. Maybe ""Koofteh"" is a meatball, so not sweet. 

Another possibility is ""Fenugreek"" sweets, but I'm not sure. Maybe ""Ghormeh Sabzi"" is a savory dish. Hmm. Let me think again. There's also ""Sholeh Zard"" which is definitely popular. Then ""Faloodeh"" is a summer dessert. ""Gaz"" is another one. ""Kashkadeh"" is a sweet soup. ""Shirini Bastani"" and ""Shirini Kourma"" are specific types. Also, ""Zulbia"" is a type of deep-fried doughnut-like sweet. 

Wait, I should make sure these are actually popular in Iran. Maybe I should list the most commonly mentioned ones. So compiling the list: Sholeh Zard, Faloodeh, Gaz, Kashkadeh, Shirini Bastani, Shirini Kourma, and Zulbia. Are there others? Maybe ""Noghl"" which is a type of nougat made with honey and nuts. That's also popular",1,,,,1,0.5
New-in-01,Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Iran. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall the coffee shop chains present in Iran. I know that Starbucks is a global brand and is present in many countries. However, Iran has had some restrictions on foreign brands, especially after the 1979 revolution. But Starbucks did open a location in Tehran in 2009, which was a big deal. However, I'm not sure if they are the most popular.

Then there's a local chain called Chai Khan. Wait, no, Chai Khan is more of a traditional tea house. Maybe there's another local brand. I remember hearing about a chain called ""Caf칠 19"" or something similar. Or perhaps ""Kaveh"" is a local brand. Alternatively, maybe there's a chain like ""Nabati"" which is a well-known Iranian brand, but I'm not sure if they have coffee shops.

Wait, another thought: in Iran, due to the cultural and religious context, coffee shops might not be as common as in Western countries. Instead, traditional tea houses (chay khaneh) are more prevalent. However, with the influence of globalization, some international chains might have entered the market. But considering the restrictions on alcohol and certain Western influences, maybe local brands are more dominant.

Alternatively, there's a chain called ""Saray"" which might have coffee shops. But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the most popular is actually a local chain like ""Kaveh"" or ""Cafe Melli."" However, I need to verify which one is actually the most popular.

Wait, I think I've read before that Starbucks is the most popular in Iran, despite the political issues. They have a few locations, and they are well-known. However, there might be local competitors. Alternatively, maybe there's a brand called ""Nabati"" which is popular for other products, but not sure about coffee.

Alternatively, maybe there are no major international chains, and local brands dominate. But I'm not sure. To be safe, perhaps the answer is Starbucks, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe there's no single most popular brand, but the user is expecting an answer. Given that Starbucks is present and known, maybe that's the answer. However, I should check if there's a more accurate local brand.

New-ch-73,What type of clubs are most popular among university students in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what types of clubs are most popular among university students in Iran. Let me start by thinking about the cultural and social context of Iran. Iran is a predominantly Muslim country with a strong emphasis on education, so universities there might have a range of clubs that reflect both academic and cultural interests.

First, I know that in many countries, academic and professional clubs are popular because they help students with their studies and future careers. So maybe in Iran, there are clubs related to engineering, computer science, or other technical fields. Also, considering the importance of religion in Iranian society, there might be Islamic or cultural clubs that focus on promoting Islamic values, Quranic studies, or traditional Iranian culture.

Another angle is social and recreational clubs. Sports clubs are usually popular everywhere, so maybe football (soccer) or basketball clubs are common. Also, debate clubs or public speaking clubs might be present, especially if universities encourage critical thinking and communication skills.

I should also consider the political environment. In Iran, political awareness is part of the education system, so there might be political or social activism clubs. However, I need to be cautious here because some clubs might be restricted or monitored, so their popularity might not be as openly visible.

Additionally, arts and literature clubs could be prevalent. Iran has a rich literary tradition, so clubs focused on poetry, writing, or theater might be popular. Also, language clubs, especially for learning English or other foreign languages, could be common due to the value placed on language skills for academic and professional advancement.

I should also think about technology and innovation. With the rise of tech industries, coding clubs, robotics, or entrepreneurship clubs might be gaining popularity among Iranian students, especially in larger universities with more resources.

However, I need to verify if these assumptions are accurate. For example, while Islamic clubs are likely present, are they the most popular? Or are academic clubs more dominant? Also, considering the gender dynamics in Iran, are there specific clubs that are more popular among male or female students?

Another thought: in some countries, clubs related to national identity or heritage are popular. Since Iran has a distinct culture, clubs promoting Persian language, traditional music, or dance might be common. Also, environmental clubs could be emerging, reflecting global trends towards sustainability.

But I need to prioritize the most popular ones. Based on available information, academic and professional clubs, Islamic/cultural clubs, sports clubs, and language clubs are likely the top ones. Political clubs might be less visible due to restrictions",1,,,,1,1.0

New-en-05,Which food is a cost-effective and quick meal option in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about a cost-effective and quick meal option in Iran. I need to think about common Iranian foods that fit both criteria.

First, cost-effective. In many countries, staples like bread, rice, or beans are cheap. Iran has a lot of dishes based on these ingredients. Quick meal options would be things that don't take long to prepare.

Chelow is a type of rice, often served with kebabs. But maybe that's more of a main dish. Tahdig is the crispy layer at the bottom of the rice, but that might take longer to cook. 

Then there's something like khoresht, which is a stew. But stews might take more time. Maybe a simpler dish. 

Wait, there's a dish called ""Ghormeh Sabzi"" which is a herb stew with kidney beans and lamb. But again, that might take some time. 

What about something like ""Esfahan"" or ""Fesenj캐n""? No, those are more complex. 

Oh, maybe ""Shorba"" which is a soup. But not sure if it's quick. 

Wait, there's ""Tahdig"" but again, that's part of chelow. 

Another thought: ""Kufteh"" is meatballs, but preparing them might take time. 

Wait, maybe ""Pilaf"" is a quick rice dish. But I think pilaf is similar to chelow. 

Wait, what about ""Sholeh Zard""? That's a sweet rice pudding, but that's dessert. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Kashk"" which is a type of yogurt-based soup. But not sure about the preparation time. 

Wait, in Iran, street food is common. ""Kebab"" is popular, but that might be more expensive. 

Wait, ""Tahdig"" with just rice and maybe some seasoning. But maybe a simpler version. 

Alternatively, ""Chelow"" with just rice and a simple stew. But I think the most common quick and cheap meal would be ""Chelow"" with a simple side. But maybe the answer is ""Chelow"" or ""Tahdig"". 

Wait, maybe ""Shorba"" is a quick soup. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, ""Fatteh"" which is a dish with bread, lentils, and yogurt. But that might take some time.

New-ch-16,What is the most famous sports-related movie in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most famous sports-related movie in Iran. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall Iranian cinema and any notable sports films. I remember that Iran has produced several acclaimed films, but specifically about sports? There's a movie called ""The Runner"" which is about a young boy who runs in a race, but I'm not sure if that's the most famous one. Wait, another one that comes to mind is ""Children of Heaven."" It's about two siblings, and one of them is a boy who runs to get his sister's shoes, leading to a competition. That movie is quite famous internationally and was Iran's submission for the Academy Award. It's more about family and perseverance, but it's sports-related in the sense of running. 

Alternatively, there's a film called ""The Last Match"" which deals with a football player in a small town. But I'm not certain how famous that is compared to ""Children of Heaven."" Another possibility is ""Offside,"" which is about a group of girls trying to sneak into a football match. That's more about football, but I think ""Children of Heaven"" is more widely recognized. 

I should verify if ""Children of Heaven"" is considered a sports-related movie. The main plot involves the boy running, which is a key scene, but the movie is more about family and social issues. However, since the user is asking for sports-related, maybe that's the closest. Alternatively, maybe there's another film that's more directly about sports. 

Wait, ""The Runner"" is about a boy participating in a race, which is a sports event. But I think ""Children of Heaven"" is more famous globally. However, in Iran, maybe ""The Runner"" is more recognized. But I'm not sure. Let me check my knowledge again. 

""Children of Heaven"" (1997) directed by Majid Majidi is indeed one of Iran's most famous films. The running scene is iconic, and it's often cited as a sports-related film because of that. Even though the primary focus isn't on sports, the running competition is a central element. 

Another film is ""The Last Match"" (2009) about a football player, but it's less known. ""Offside"" (2006) is more about football, but it's a comedy. However, ""Children of Heaven"" is the most internationally recognized. 

Therefore, the answer is likely",1,,,,1,1.0
Ji-ko-25,What are the family-related holidays in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the family-related holidays in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian holidays. First, there's Nowruz, which is the Persian New Year. It's a big one, usually celebrated in March, and it's definitely family-oriented with gatherings and traditions like the Haft-sin table.

Then there's the Islamic New Year, which is called Hijri New Year. But I'm not sure if that's widely celebrated in Iran. Maybe it's more of a religious observance rather than a family holiday. Wait, I should check that. Alternatively, maybe it's not a public holiday in Iran, so perhaps I shouldn't include it.

Next, there's the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on February 11th. That's a public holiday, but it's more political and religious, so maybe not family-focused. Then there's the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, which is also a religious holiday, so probably not family-related.

What about the spring equinox, which is part of Nowruz? That's covered under Nowruz. Then there's the end of Ramadan, which is Eid al-Fitr. That's a major holiday with family gatherings, feasting, and visiting relatives. So that's definitely a family-related holiday.

Then there's Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice. It's also a time for family gatherings, though it's more about the religious aspect of sacrifice. Still, families come together, so maybe it's included.

There's also the anniversary of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, which is Ashura. That's a significant religious holiday, but again, more about mourning and religious observance rather than family time. Maybe not family-related in the same way.

What about other holidays? There's the birthday of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, on April 4th. That's a public holiday, but again, more political than family-oriented.

So, narrowing it down, the main family-related holidays would be Nowruz and Eid al-Fitr. Eid al-Adha might be considered as well, but I'm not certain if it's as family-focused in Iran compared to other countries. Let me verify if there are others. Maybe the summer vacation period or other traditional holidays? I don't recall specific ones. So the primary ones are Nowruz and Eid al-Fitr. Maybe also the end of the month of Muharram, but that's part of the Ash",1,,,,1,1.0
Sa-en-7,What are popular snacks in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about popular snacks in Iran and wants the answer in a specific JSON format. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian snacks. I remember that there are several traditional snacks that are commonly eaten there.

First, there's ""Baghali Polo,"" but wait, isn't that a rice dish with fava beans and dill? Maybe that's more of a main dish than a snack. Let me think again. Oh right, there's ""Kuku,"" which is an egg and herb frittata, often made with dill or spinach. That's a common snack.

Then there's ""Faloodeh,"" a sweet, icy dessert made with vermicelli noodles and rose water. That's definitely a popular treat. ""Sholeh Zard"" is another dessert, a saffron-flavored rice pudding. But I'm not sure if it's considered a snack or a dessert. Maybe both?

""Torshi"" is pickled vegetables, which are often served as a side or snack. ""Koloocheh"" are sweet pastries filled with nuts and saffron, commonly sold by street vendors. ""Samosas"" or ""Shami Kebab"" might be more common in other regions, but in Iran, they have their own versions like ""Kebab"" in general, but maybe that's not a snack.

""Zoolbia"" are deep-fried dough balls with a honey glaze, often enjoyed as a sweet snack. ""Baklava"" is also popular, though it's more of a dessert. ""Shirin Polo"" is a sweet rice dish, but again, maybe not a snack.

Wait, ""Paklava"" is similar to baklava, so that's another possibility. ""Kale Pacheh"" is a soup, not a snack. ""Kashk"" is a yogurt-based dish, but again, more of a main course.

Let me check if I'm missing any. ""Ash Reshteh"" is a soup, so no. ""Tahdig"" is part of a meal. ""Mast-o-Khiar"" is yogurt with cucumber, a refreshing snack. ""Doogh"" is a yogurt drink, but that's a beverage.

So compiling this: Kuku, Faloodeh, Sholeh Zard, Torshi, Koloocheh, Zoolbia, Paklava, Mast-o-Khiar. Maybe also """,1,,,,0,0

New-en-56,What is the most popular foreign language spoken by families in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular foreign language spoken by families in Iran is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iran's language landscape. The official language is Persian, also known as Farsi. But the question is about foreign languages, so that's not it.

I remember that in many countries, English is often the most commonly taught foreign language. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Iran. Maybe there's another reason. Let me think about Iran's history and education system. The Iranian education system has traditionally emphasized learning foreign languages, and I think Russian was a significant one, especially during the Soviet era. However, after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, there might have been a shift towards English due to global influence and the need for international communication.

Also, considering neighboring countries, some might speak Arabic or Turkish, but those are more regional rather than foreign. However, Arabic is widely understood because of religious texts and media. But the question specifies ""foreign languages,"" which might exclude languages spoken in neighboring regions. Wait, but Arabic is a foreign language for Iranians since it's not part of their native languages.

Another angle: I've heard that in recent years, there's been an increase in English language learning in Iran, partly due to the internet and exposure to Western media. However, there might still be a preference for Russian or French in some contexts. For example, French might have been taught in schools for a long time. But I'm not sure about the current popularity.

Wait, let me check some sources. From what I recall, in Iran, English is the most commonly taught foreign language in schools. However, due to political reasons, there's been a push to replace English with Russian, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe English remains the most popular despite that.

Alternatively, there might be a significant number of people who know Russian due to historical ties, but I think the majority of Iranians who study a foreign language are likely to be studying English. Also, considering the availability of English media, movies, and the internet, it's possible that English is more widely spoken among families compared to other languages.

But I should be careful here. I might be conflating the most taught with the most spoken. However, since the question is about families, it's possible that English is the most common. However, I need to verify this. Another thought: in some regions of Iran, like the north, there might",1,,,,1,1.0
Jo-sp-13,What is the most popular water sport in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular water sport in Iran is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iran's geography and culture. Iran has a lot of coastline along the Caspian Sea, and there are also rivers and lakes. So water sports might be common there.

First, I should think about common water sports globally. Things like swimming, sailing, kayaking, fishing, maybe even water skiing. But which ones are popular in Iran specifically?

I remember that Iran has a significant number of people who engage in sports, and some traditional sports are popular. However, water sports might be more influenced by the availability of water bodies. The Caspian Sea is a big factor here. Maybe sailing or windsurfing? I've heard that some parts of the Caspian have good conditions for sailing.

Another angle: maybe rowing? Iran has a strong presence in international rowing competitions. The country has produced several Olympic rowers. So rowing could be a popular sport. But is it considered a water sport? Yes, rowing is definitely a water sport.

Wait, but the question is about the most popular. So between rowing and other sports like sailing or swimming. I need to check if there's any data or sources that indicate which is more popular. However, since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

Rowing is a team sport and might be more organized. Iran has rowing clubs and facilities, especially in cities near the Caspian Sea like Bandar Anzali. Also, the Iranian national rowing team has been successful in international competitions, which might contribute to its popularity.

Swimming is also popular, but maybe more as an individual sport. However, the question is about the most popular water sport. If rowing is both a team sport with organized competitions and has a strong presence in the country, it might be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe fishing? But fishing is more of a recreational activity rather than a sport. Sailing or windsurfing might be popular in certain coastal areas, but I don't know if they are the most popular overall.

Another thought: Iran has a lot of lakes and rivers, but the Caspian Sea is the main body of water. So sports related to that would be more prominent. If rowing is a major sport there, that could be the answer.

I think the answer is rowing. But I need to make sure I'm not confusing it with another sport.",1,,,,1,1.0

New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Iran? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Iranian education system. Middle school in Iran typically refers to the second stage of compulsory education, which is usually for students around 12 to 15 years old. 

First, I should check the structure of the curriculum. In many countries, middle school subjects include core areas like mathematics, science, language, social studies, physical education, and maybe arts or foreign languages. But Iran might have its own specific subjects.

I remember that the Iranian curriculum emphasizes religious education, so subjects like Islamic studies or ethics might be included. Also, there's a focus on Persian language and literature. Let me think about the standard subjects. 

In primary school, the curriculum is more basic, but middle school introduces more specialized subjects. For example, in Iran, middle school might have subjects like:

1. Persian Language and Literature
2. Mathematics
3. Science and Technology (or separate subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
4. Social Studies (including history, geography, civics)
5. Islamic Studies or Ethics
6. Physical Education
7. Foreign Language (usually English)
8. Art and Music
9. Computer Skills
10. Civics and Law
11. Technical and Vocational Education (maybe)
12. Health Education

Wait, but I'm not sure if all these are taught in middle school. Also, the number might vary depending on the school type (public vs. private) or regional differences. However, the question is asking for the number of subjects in general. 

I should verify if there's an official list. From what I've read before, the Iranian middle school curriculum includes around 12 subjects. But I need to be precise. Let me think again. 

Another approach: in some sources, the subjects are listed as Persian, Math, Science, Social Studies, Islamic Education, Physical Education, Foreign Language, Art, Computer, and maybe Technical Education. That might be around 10 subjects, but perhaps some are split into more. For example, Science could be split into Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, making that three subjects. Similarly, Social Studies might be split into History, Geography, and Civics. That could bring the total to 12 or more. 

However, I think the standard answer often cited is 12 subjects. But I need to be careful. Maybe the exact number is 1",1,,,,1,1.0
Th-en-03,What is the most popular professional sports league in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular professional sports league in Iran. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall which sports are popular in Iran. I know that football (soccer) is a major sport there, similar to many other countries. The Iranian football league, probably the Persian Gulf Pro League, comes to mind. But wait, are there other leagues?

Let me check. Iran has other sports like basketball, volleyball, and maybe wrestling, but I think football is the most followed. The Pro League is the top tier of Iranian football. There's also the Iran Volleyball Super League, but I don't think it's as popular as football. Cricket has been growing, but I'm not sure if it's professional yet. The Iranian Basketball Super League exists, but again, not as prominent as football.

So the answer should be the Persian Gulf Pro League. Wait, sometimes it's called the Iran Pro League. I need to confirm the exact name. The league was previously known as the Persian Gulf Pro League, but I think it's now called the Iran Pro League. However, the exact name might vary based on sponsorship. But the most recognized name is the Persian Gulf Pro League. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer as ""Iran Pro League"" now. Hmm.

But regardless of the name, the key point is that it's the top football league. Since the question is about the most popular, and football is the most popular sport in Iran, the league would be the one for football. So the answer is the Persian Gulf Pro League, or Iran Pro League. I need to make sure which name is more commonly used now. A quick check in my mind: Iran Pro League is the current name, but sometimes it's referred to by its former sponsor name. However, the user might expect the official current name. But since I can't look it up, I'll go with the most commonly recognized name, which is the Persian Gulf Pro League. Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply the Iran Football Premier League. Wait, I think the official name is Iran Pro League, which was previously known as the Persian Gulf Pro League. So perhaps the answer is Iran Pro League. However, I need to be cautious. Maybe the user expects the answer as the Persian Gulf Pro League. I'll go with that since it's a well-known name, even if it's a former name. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Iran Football League. But I think the most accurate answer",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ha-08,What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Iran. Let me start by recalling Iranian cuisine. There are a lot of dishes, but some might be more acquired tastes. For example, things that are spicy or have strong flavors might not appeal to children. 

I remember that some traditional Iranian foods use ingredients like sumac, which is a sour spice, or dried lime, which has a strong taste. Also, there's a dish called ""fesenj캐n,"" which is a thick stew made with pomegranate molasses and walnuts. That's quite rich and has a strong flavor. Maybe that's something kids don't like but older people do?

Another possibility is ""ghormeh sabzi,"" which is a herb stew with kidney beans and lamb. It's quite savory and has a lot of herbs. But I'm not sure if that's disliked by children. 

There's also ""tahdig,"" which is the crispy bottom of the rice dish. But that's usually liked by everyone. 

Wait, maybe something with yogurt? Like ""mast-o-khiar,"" which is cucumber and yogurt. But again, not sure about the age factor. 

I think I've heard that ""kashk"" is a byproduct of yogurt production, used in soups. It has a strong, sour taste. Children might find it too intense, while the elderly might prefer it. 

Alternatively, maybe ""shirin polo,"" which is sweet rice with barberries. But that's more of a dessert, so maybe not. 

Another angle: some foods are considered healthier or more traditional. Maybe ""dolma,"" which is stuffed grape leaves. But again, not sure about the age preference. 

Wait, I think the answer is ""kashk"" or ""ghormeh sabzi."" But I need to confirm. Let me think again. 

In some cultures, certain dishes are considered more mature. In Iran, maybe ""ghormeh sabzi"" is too strong for children. Also, ""fesenj캐n"" is quite rich and has a complex flavor. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, ""kufteh"" (meatballs) might be disliked by kids, but I don't think so. 

Wait, maybe ""kashk"" is the answer. It's a fermented yogurt product, very sour. Kids might not like the sour taste, while the elderly might prefer",1,,,,1,0.3333333333333333
Ji-ko-45,What do people look forward to the most at university festivals in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people look forward to the most at university festivals in Iran. Let me start by recalling what I know about Iranian university festivals. 

First, I know that in many countries, university festivals include events like music, art exhibitions, food fairs, and cultural activities. But Iran has its own unique cultural context. Since Iran has a rich cultural heritage, maybe traditional music and dance performances are part of these festivals. Also, considering the religious aspects, there might be events that blend traditional and religious elements.

However, I should also think about the social aspect. University students often enjoy socializing, so maybe there are opportunities for networking, meeting new people, or participating in group activities. There might be competitions or contests, like poetry recitation, debates, or sports events, which are popular in academic settings.

Another angle is food. In many places, food stalls and local cuisine are a big part of festivals. Iran has delicious traditional foods, so maybe that's a highlight. Also, considering the climate, if the festivals are held in specific seasons, there might be outdoor activities or seasonal events.

But I should verify if there's something more specific. I recall that in Iran, cultural and artistic expressions are significant, so perhaps music and dance performances, especially those rooted in Persian culture, are highly anticipated. Also, university festivals might include exhibitions of student work, art shows, or theater performances. 

Wait, but the question asks for what people look forward to the most. So it's the top priority. Maybe the most anticipated part is the cultural performances, especially traditional music and dance, as they are a key part of Iranian identity. Alternatively, food could be a big draw. However, I need to be careful not to assume without evidence.

I should check if there are any sources or common knowledge about this. From what I remember, Iranian university festivals often feature traditional music, poetry, and dance, which are deeply rooted in the country's culture. These events might include performances by student groups or guest artists. Additionally, there might be competitions in poetry or calligraphy, which are respected arts in Iran. 

Another possibility is the social aspect, like meeting peers, but that's more general. The unique aspect of Iranian festivals might be the blend of traditional and modern elements, so perhaps the cultural performances are the main attraction. 

Considering all this, I think the primary answer would be traditional music and dance performances, as they are a significant part of the cultural expression in Iran and likely a major highlight",1,,,,,
Ji-ko-33,Where do high school students in Iran usually go after dinner?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out where high school students in Iran usually go after dinner. Let me start by thinking about the cultural and social norms in Iran. Iran is a conservative country with strict religious laws, so the activities that students engage in might be influenced by those factors.

First, after dinner, what do teenagers typically do? In many countries, they might hang out with friends, go to the park, or use social media. But in Iran, there might be restrictions on certain activities, especially for minors. For example, public places might have curfews or require chaperones. Also, internet access could be limited, or there might be restrictions on social media platforms.

I remember that in Iran, there are specific times when the internet is blocked, especially during certain hours. So maybe students use the internet during the day or early evening, but after dinner, they might not have access. Alternatively, they might use mobile data or find ways to access the internet discreetly.

Another possibility is that they might go to study groups or tutoring centers. Since education is highly valued in Iran, students might have homework or need to study for exams. So after dinner, they could go to a study group or a private tutor's house.

Also, family time is important in Iranian culture. Maybe after dinner, students spend time with their families, helping with chores or just relaxing at home. But the question is about where they go, so if they stay home, that's a possible answer. However, the question might be looking for places outside the home.

Wait, but considering the strict laws, going out might be restricted. For example, girls might not be allowed to be out alone, and there could be restrictions on gathering in public places. So maybe students stay home or go to places that are permissible, like religious gatherings or approved youth centers.

Alternatively, some might go to parks or public spaces if they're allowed. But I'm not sure if that's common. Another angle is that high school students might have part-time jobs, but that's less likely after dinner. Or maybe they attend religious classes or study circles.

I think the most probable answer is that they stay home, study, or attend study groups. But I need to confirm. Let me check if there are any specific common activities. Also, considering that in Iran, after dinner, families might gather for TV or socializing, so students might be at home. However, if the question is about going out, maybe they go to places like internet cafes",1,,,,,

Al-en-36,What food is associated with Halloween in Iran?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the food associated with Halloween in Iran. Hmm, first, I need to recall if Halloween is celebrated in Iran. I know that Halloween is more common in Western countries, but in Iran, they might have their own traditions or maybe they've adopted some elements from Western culture.

Wait, but I'm not sure if there's a specific food linked to Halloween there. Maybe they don't celebrate Halloween in the same way as the West. However, the question is about food associated with it. Maybe they have something similar to trick-or-treating, but with local foods?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a traditional Iranian dish that's eaten around that time. But I need to be careful not to confuse it with other festivals. For example, in some countries, they might have specific foods for other holidays that could be mistaken for Halloween. Or maybe they use the occasion to eat sweets, similar to how children get candy on Halloween.

But I'm not finding any specific Iranian food that's directly tied to Halloween. It's possible that Halloween isn't widely celebrated there, so there might not be a traditional food associated with it. However, if they do celebrate, maybe they use the same types of treats as in the West, like candies or sweets. But the question is asking for something specific to Iran.

Wait, maybe I should check if there's any local tradition. For example, in Iran, there's a festival called ""Shab-e Yalda"" which is related to the winter solstice, but that's in December. Not sure if that's related to Halloween. Alternatively, maybe they have a similar concept of ""ghost night"" or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a more recent trend where people in Iran, influenced by Western media, might have started eating certain foods for Halloween. But without specific knowledge, I can't be certain. However, since the user is asking for an answer, I need to provide the best possible response based on available information.

After some thought, I think that Halloween is not traditionally celebrated in Iran, so there isn't a specific food associated with it. However, if people do partake in Halloween celebrations, they might consume general sweets or candy similar to Western practices. But since the question is about something specific to Iran, I might have to say that there isn't a traditional food associated with Halloween in Iran. Alternatively, maybe a local treat is used, but I can't recall any.

Wait, maybe ""Gh",1,,,,,
