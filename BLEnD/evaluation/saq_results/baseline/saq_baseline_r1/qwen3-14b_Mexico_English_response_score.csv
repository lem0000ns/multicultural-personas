New-ko-02,What is the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular prenatal education activity is for pregnant women in Mexico. Let me start by recalling what I know about prenatal education. In many countries, activities like childbirth classes, nutrition workshops, exercise programs, or support groups are common. But I'm not sure about Mexico specifically.

First, maybe I should think about cultural factors. In Mexico, family and community support are very important. So perhaps activities that involve family members or community groups are more popular. Also, traditional practices might play a role. However, prenatal education is often more about modern health practices now.

I remember that in some Latin American countries, there's a focus on preparing for labor and delivery through classes. Maybe ""clases de preparación al parto"" (childbirth preparation classes) are common. These classes might cover breathing techniques, pain management, and what to expect during labor. But I should check if that's the case in Mexico.

Another possibility is that prenatal yoga or exercise classes are popular, as they are in many places. However, I'm not certain if that's the most popular in Mexico. Alternatively, there might be government-run programs or initiatives that promote specific activities. For example, in some countries, the government partners with health organizations to provide free or low-cost prenatal education.

I should also consider the role of healthcare providers. In Mexico, public health services might offer certain programs. Maybe the most popular activity is attending prenatal check-ups combined with educational sessions. But the question specifies an activity, so it's more likely a specific program or class.

Wait, I've heard that in Mexico, there's a program called ""Salud Mujer"" which provides prenatal care and education. Maybe that includes certain activities. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular. Alternatively, ""clases de natación prenatal"" (prenatal swimming classes) might be popular, but again, not sure.

Another angle: looking up statistics or reports. However, since I can't access external sources, I need to rely on existing knowledge. In many countries, childbirth education classes are the most common, so perhaps that's the case in Mexico. Alternatively, workshops on nutrition and healthy eating during pregnancy could be popular, especially with the rise of health-conscious trends.

Wait, but the question asks for the most popular. If I have to choose one, I think childbirth preparation classes are likely the answer. But I should make sure there isn't a more specific or different activity unique to Mexico. For example,",1,,,,0,0

Ne-ar-09,What do people from Mexico eat in Eid ul Fitr?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what people from Mexico eat during Eid ul Fitr. First, I need to recall what Eid ul Fitr is. It's a Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. So, it's a time when Muslims celebrate with feasts and special foods.

Now, the question is about Mexico. Mexico's primary cuisine is Mexican, which includes dishes like tamales, tacos, enchiladas, etc. But Eid ul Fitr is a religious holiday specific to Islam, so I need to think about the Muslim community in Mexico. Are there significant Muslim populations in Mexico? I know that Mexico has a small but present Muslim community, possibly from various ethnic backgrounds, including immigrants from Middle Eastern countries or converts.

However, during Eid ul Fitr, the food might be influenced by both traditional Mexican dishes and the cultural practices of the Muslim community. But since the question is about what people from Mexico eat, not necessarily the Muslim community in Mexico, there might be a confusion here. Wait, the question is phrased as ""people from Mexico"" which might imply the general population, but Eid ul Fitr is a Muslim holiday. So, perhaps the user is confused, thinking that people in Mexico celebrate Eid ul Fitr, which they might not. However, there might be some Muslims in Mexico who do celebrate it, but they might not have specific Mexican dishes for the occasion.

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different holiday, like Christmas or another festival, but the question specifically mentions Eid ul Fitr. So, the answer would be that people in Mexico, who are not Muslim, may not observe Eid ul Fitr, so they don't have specific traditional foods for it. However, the Muslim community in Mexico might prepare traditional Middle Eastern dishes for Eid, like dates, sweets, or dishes common in the Islamic world, but not necessarily Mexican ones. However, since the question is about people from Mexico, not the Muslim community there, the answer might be that they don't have a specific traditional dish for Eid ul Fitr because it's not a widely observed holiday in Mexico, and thus the general population doesn't have a traditional meal associated with it. Alternatively, if there are any Mexican dishes that are part of the celebrations by the local Muslim community, but I'm not sure if that's the case. 

Another angle: Maybe the user is conflating Eid ul Fitr with another festival. But assuming the question is correct",1,,,,,
New-su-24,What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in Mexico. Let me start by thinking about popular sports in Mexico. Soccer, or fútbol, is huge there. I know that kids often play soccer in the streets, and maybe parents join in too. Then there's baseball, which is also popular, especially in some regions. Maybe they play that together as a family.

What about other sports? Maybe something like volleyball? I've heard that beach volleyball is popular in places like Cancun. But would parents and kids play that together? Maybe. Then there's basketball, but I'm not sure how common that is for families. Also, maybe traditional games like lotería or other games that are more social but not necessarily sports. But the question specifies sports.

Another thought: in Mexico, there's a lot of emphasis on family activities. So maybe they play games that are easy to do together, like frisbee, which doesn't require much equipment. Or maybe something like tag, which is simple and can be played anywhere. But are these considered sports? Maybe in a casual sense.

I should also consider if there are any sports that are specifically promoted for families. Maybe something like swimming, but that would depend on access to pools or beaches. Also, maybe martial arts like karate or taekwondo, but that might be more structured and not necessarily a casual family activity.

Wait, I remember seeing kids playing with their parents in parks doing things like soccer, maybe even street hockey. Also, in some communities, they might play traditional games that are similar to sports. But I need to be specific. Let me check if there are any official sources or common knowledge about this.

Alternatively, maybe sports like ""juego de pelota,"" which is a traditional Mesoamerican ballgame, but that might be more of a cultural event rather than a common family sport today. So probably not that.

So compiling this, the most likely answers are soccer, baseball, volleyball, and maybe basketball. Also, maybe activities like frisbee or tag. But I need to make sure these are commonly played together. Since the user asked for a list, maybe stick to the more traditional sports. Also, considering that in Mexico, family time often involves outdoor activities, so soccer is a big one. Maybe also something like ""futbolín,"" which is table football, but that's more of a game than a sport. But the question says sports, so maybe not.

So",1,,,,1,1.0
Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in Mexico's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the required subjects in Mexico's university entrance exam. Let me think. I know that in Mexico, the main entrance exam for universities is the Examen Nacional de Ingreso a la Educación Superior (EXANI), which is administered by Ceneval.

Now, the EXANI has different versions depending on the level of study. For undergraduate programs, there's EXANI-II, and for graduate studies, there's EXANI-III. But the user didn't specify the level, so maybe I should consider the most common one, which is the undergraduate level.

Looking up the EXANI-II, the required subjects typically include Spanish, Mathematics, and a Foreign Language (usually English). Wait, but does the foreign language count as a required subject? I think in some cases, the foreign language is part of the exam, but maybe it's optional depending on the university or program. Hmm, but the question is about the required subjects for the exam itself, not the university's specific requirements.

Wait, the EXANI-II has different modules. The General Knowledge module includes Spanish, Mathematics, and a Foreign Language. Then there's the Specific Knowledge module, which varies by the program. But the user is asking for the required subjects in the entrance exam, so the core ones would be Spanish, Mathematics, and Foreign Language. However, some sources might not list the foreign language as required, maybe it's part of the optional modules. Let me check again.

Actually, the EXANI-II consists of two parts: the General Knowledge (which includes Spanish, Mathematics, and Foreign Language) and the Specific Knowledge (which depends on the program, like Biology, Chemistry, etc.). But the required subjects for the exam itself, regardless of the program, would be the ones in the General Knowledge part. However, some universities might not require the foreign language part. Wait, but the question is about the required subjects in the entrance exam, not the specific university's requirements.

I think the answer is that the required subjects are Spanish, Mathematics, and a Foreign Language (usually English). But I need to confirm if the foreign language is mandatory. Some sources say that the EXANI-II includes a Foreign Language module, but it's not always required for all programs. However, the user is asking for the required subjects in the exam, so maybe the answer is the three subjects: Spanish, Mathematics, and Foreign Language. Alternatively, maybe only Spanish and Mathematics are required, and the foreign language is optional. I need to be accurate",1,,,,1,1.0

Th-en-53,What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Mexico. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what extracurricular activities are common in Mexican schools. Extracurriculars include things like sports, clubs, cultural events, etc. Social events would be those that bring students together outside of regular classes.

In many countries, sports events are popular. Mexico has a strong tradition in sports like soccer, basketball, and volleyball. School sports days or tournaments might be common. But are they considered social events? Maybe, but perhaps there's something more specifically social.

Then there are cultural events. Mexico has a rich cultural heritage, so events like festivals, dances, or traditional celebrations might be part of school activities. For example, Día de los Muertos is a big cultural event, but is that an extracurricular school event? Maybe not every school does that, but perhaps other cultural festivals.

Another possibility is school dances or prom-like events. In the US, prom is a big social event, but I'm not sure about Mexico. Maybe similar events exist, like ""bailes"" or school dances. However, I need to verify if these are widespread.

Also, there are academic competitions, but those are more academic than social. Then there's the ""fiestas"" or parties, but maybe not organized by schools as extracurriculars.

Wait, I remember that in Mexico, ""ferias escolares"" (school fairs) are common. These are events where students participate in various activities, games, food stalls, and performances. They are social events that involve the whole school community. They might be more popular than sports events because they include a variety of activities and are more inclusive.

Alternatively, ""Día del Estudiante"" (Student Day) might be a school event with games, competitions, and social activities. But I need to check which is more prevalent.

Another angle: looking at the most common events. Sports events are definitely common, but maybe not the most social. School fairs or carnivals might be more social. Also, in some schools, there might be talent shows or cultural presentations, but those are more performance-based.

I think the answer might be ""school fairs"" or ""school carnivals"" (ferias escolares). These events are typically social, involve the entire student body, and include various activities that encourage interaction. They are often held annually and are a major event in schools",1,,,,0,0

New-ch-44,"How long is the typical probation period for new employees before signing a formal contract in Mexico? (e.g., 1 month).","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the typical probation period for new employees in Mexico before signing a formal contract. Let me start by recalling what I know about labor laws in Mexico.

I remember that Mexico has specific labor regulations under the Federal Labor Law. Probation periods, or ""prueba"" in Spanish, are allowed but there are rules around them. From what I've studied before, the probation period can't exceed 90 days. However, this might vary depending on the type of contract. For example, if it's a fixed-term contract, the probation period might be different compared to an indefinite contract. 

Wait, but the question is about the period before signing a formal contract. So maybe they're referring to the time before the contract is signed, which could be part of the probation period. However, in Mexico, the probation period is usually part of the employment contract. So when an employee starts, they might be on probation for a certain period, and after that, the formal contract is signed. 

But I think the standard probation period is up to 90 days. However, I should check if there are any exceptions. For example, some companies might have shorter periods, like 30 days, but the legal maximum is 90 days. The user is asking for the typical duration, not the maximum. So maybe the answer is 90 days, but I need to be sure.

Alternatively, maybe in practice, companies often use a shorter period, like 1 month, but the law allows up to 90 days. The question is about the typical period. I should confirm if the typical is 90 days or if there's a common practice of 1 month. 

Looking up some sources, I see that in Mexico, the probation period is generally up to 90 days, but it can be shorter. However, the employer must specify the probation period in the contract. If not specified, the default is 30 days. But the maximum allowed is 90 days. So the typical might be 30 days, but the legal maximum is 90. However, the question is about the typical, not the maximum. 

Wait, the user's example is 1 month, which is 30 days. But maybe the answer is that there's no fixed typical period, but the maximum is 90 days. However, the question is phrased as ""the typical probation period,"" so perhaps the answer is that it varies but",1,,,,1,0.5

Ne-ar-38,Which food do people usually offer as charity in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking which food is typically offered as charity in Mexico. Let me think. I know that in many Latin American countries, traditional foods are often associated with charitable acts or festivals. In Mexico, there's a famous dish called pan de muerto, which is a sweet bread made for Día de los Muertos. But wait, is that specifically for charity?

Wait, maybe it's more about the pan de muerto being offered in cemeteries as part of the Day of the Dead celebrations. However, the question is about charity in general, not specifically that holiday. Are there other foods commonly given as charity?

Alternatively, maybe it's tamales. Tamales are a traditional Mexican food, often associated with celebrations and community events. During holidays or charitable events, communities might distribute tamales as a way to share food with those in need. But I'm not sure if that's the primary one for charity specifically.

Another angle: in some regions, people might offer certain foods during religious festivals or charity events. For example, during the Christmas season, maybe they give out traditional foods like buñuelos or other sweets. However, I need to be precise here.

Wait, I recall that in Mexico, the pan de muerto is often given to the poor or left at altars, but is that considered charity? Or is it more of a cultural tradition rather than charity? The user might be conflating charity with traditional offerings.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is pan dulce (sweet bread) in general, as it's a common item in charity drives. But I'm not certain. I need to verify if there's a specific food commonly associated with charitable acts in Mexico.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not a specific food but more about the act of sharing traditional meals. However, the question asks for a specific food. Let me think again. In some cases, during religious events or community gatherings, people might donate tamales, but I'm not sure if that's the main one.

Wait, I think the answer might be ""pan de muerto"" because it's a traditional item associated with Día de los Muertos and sometimes given to the less fortunate. However, I need to be cautious not to conflate the holiday with general charity. Alternatively, maybe it's not a specific food but more about the community's traditional dishes. But the user wants a specific answer.

New-gr-06,What is the most popular food in Mexico among young people?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular food in Mexico is among young people. Let me start by recalling what I know about Mexican cuisine. Traditional dishes like tacos, enchiladas, and tamales are staples, but I wonder if there's something more specific that's trending with younger generations.

I remember that tacos are very popular overall, but maybe there's a particular type of taco that's more favored by younger people. For example, street tacos or maybe something like al pastor? Also, there's been a rise in fusion foods or modern takes on traditional dishes. Maybe something like Korean-Mexican fusion, like tacos with kimchi or bulgogi?

Wait, but the question is about the most popular. I should check if there are any recent surveys or articles about food trends in Mexico. I know that in recent years, there's been a focus on health, so maybe plant-based options are gaining traction. However, that might not be the most popular in terms of overall consumption.

Another angle: social media influence. Young people are on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, so visually appealing foods might be more popular. Tacos, especially with colorful toppings or creative presentations, could be a hit. Also, beverages like horchata or aguas frescas might be popular, but the question is about food.

I think tacos are still the most popular, but maybe the answer is tacos in general. However, to be precise, perhaps ""tacos al pastor"" is more specific. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe ""tortas"" (Mexican sandwiches) or ""quesadillas"" are more popular among youth. Wait, but I should verify if there's a consensus on this.

Alternatively, considering global trends, maybe fast food chains like McDonald's or local fast-food options are popular, but that might not be traditional. However, the question is about Mexican food, so it's more likely to be a traditional dish.

In summary, I think the safest answer is tacos, but I need to confirm if there's a more specific answer. Since I can't look up current data, I'll go with tacos as the most popular food among young people in Mexico, possibly specifying a type like tacos al pastor or street tacos. However, the question might expect a general answer. Let me check if there's a common answer in general knowledge. Yes, tacos are widely regarded as a staple and popular among all ages, including young people. So the answer",1,,,,1,1.0

Ji-ko-14,What is the representative export item of Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the representative export item of Mexico. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Mexico's economy is diverse, but certain products stand out. They have a significant agricultural sector. I remember that avocados are a big export. Also, cars and automotive parts come to mind because Mexico has a lot of manufacturing, especially through maquiladoras. Then there's oil and natural gas, as Mexico has oil reserves. But which one is the most representative?

Wait, I should check the latest data. From what I recall, in recent years, vehicles and vehicle parts have been a major export. Also, oil is still a key export. But maybe the answer is oil? Or is it automobiles? Let me think. The automotive industry is huge in Mexico, with companies like Ford, Toyota, and BMW having plants there. So maybe vehicles are the top export. However, I should also consider other items like electronics, machinery, or agricultural products like avocados, tomatoes, or tequila. But the question is about the representative one. 

I think the top exports include oil, vehicles, and electronics. However, the most representative might be oil. Wait, but in recent years, the automotive sector has grown more. Maybe the answer varies based on the year. But the user didn't specify a time frame. Alternatively, maybe the answer is a combination, but the question says ""one single answer."" Hmm. Let me verify. 

According to recent data, Mexico's top exports include vehicles, oil, and electrical machinery. But the single most representative could be oil, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is automobiles. I think the answer might be oil, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, another angle: Mexico is a major exporter of avocados, but that's a specific agricultural product. However, in terms of value, vehicles and automotive parts might be higher. 

I need to be precise. Let me recall that in 2022, Mexico's top exports were vehicles, oil, and electrical machinery. But the question is about the representative one. Maybe the answer is oil, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the answer could be vehicles. I need to check which is more prominent. 

Wait, the question says ""representative export item,"" which might refer to the most significant or iconic. Tequila is a well-known product, but it's not the top in value. Oil is a major export, but so are",1,,,,1,1.0

Al-en-32,What is the main dish for Thanksgiving in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the main dish for Thanksgiving in Mexico. Let me think. First, I know that Thanksgiving in the US is typically associated with turkey, but Mexico has its own traditions. However, Mexico doesn't have a traditional Thanksgiving holiday like the United States. They have Día de Acción de Gracias, which is similar but not as widely celebrated. 

Wait, but maybe the user is referring to how Mexicans might celebrate Thanksgiving, perhaps in a more modern or adapted way. In some cases, people might adopt American customs, but I'm not sure if turkey is common there. Alternatively, maybe they have their own traditional dishes. Let me check.

I recall that in Mexico, traditional dishes for holidays often include things like tamales, pozole, or mole. But those are more for Christmas or other festivals. For Thanksgiving, if they do celebrate it, maybe they might have a mix of both American and Mexican dishes. However, I'm not certain if there's a specific main dish that's recognized as the primary one for Thanksgiving in Mexico.

Wait, another angle: maybe the user is confused because Thanksgiving isn't a traditional Mexican holiday. So the answer might be that there isn't a main dish specifically for Thanksgiving in Mexico, since the holiday isn't observed there. But the question is phrased as if there is one. Maybe in some communities or families, they might have turkey, but it's not a national tradition. Alternatively, maybe they use the occasion to have a traditional Mexican meal regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos), but that's a different holiday. Hmm. To clarify, I need to confirm whether Thanksgiving is celebrated in Mexico and what the common practices are. From what I know, some expats or international communities in Mexico might celebrate Thanksgiving with a meal, possibly including turkey, but it's not a traditional Mexican dish. Therefore, the main dish might not be specific, but if they do have a main dish, it could be turkey, similar to the US. However, I should verify this.

Another possibility: maybe the user is mixing up Thanksgiving with another holiday. But the question is clear. Since the user is asking for the main dish, I need to state whether there is one. If there isn't a traditional main dish, perhaps the answer is that there isn't a specific main dish, but some people might serve turkey. Alternatively, maybe they have a different dish. However, I",1,,,,,

An-ar-03,Which month is the final exam term usually scheduled at high schools in Mexico? (Provide Arabic numerals (1~12) only.),"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the month when final exams are usually scheduled in high schools in Mexico. They want the answer in Arabic numerals from 1 to 12, so just the number, not the name of the month.

First, I need to recall the Mexican academic calendar. In many countries, especially those following a similar structure to the United States, the school year starts in August or September and ends in May or June. However, Mexico might have some differences. Let me think. In Mexico, the school year typically starts in August and ends in July. So, if the school year is from August to July, the final exams would likely be towards the end of the school year. That would place them in June or July. But wait, sometimes the final exams might be in December if there's a semester system. Wait, but in Mexico, the academic year is usually divided into two semesters: the first semester from August to December, and the second from January to June or July. So, the final exams for the first semester might be in December, and the second semester in June or July. However, the question is about the final exam term, which might refer to the end of the entire school year. If the school year ends in July, then the final exams would be in June or July. But I need to confirm. Let me check my knowledge. In many Mexican high schools, the final exams for the entire year are usually held in June or July. For example, the final exams for the second semester might be in June, and the school year ends in July. So the answer would be June (6) or July (7). However, I need to be precise. If the school year ends in July, the final exams might be in June. Alternatively, some schools might have the final exams in December for the first semester and June for the second. But the question is about the final exam term, which could refer to the end of the year. So, if the school year is August to July, the final exams would be in June or July. But which one is more common? I think in many cases, the final exams are in June. For example, in the Mexican education system, the ""exámenes finales"" for the second semester are usually in June. Therefore, the answer is 6. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, if the school year is divided into two semesters, with the second semester ending",1,,,,1,0.6666666666666666
Ji-ko-28,When is the first day that people celebrate after a child is born in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the first day people celebrate after a child is born in Mexico. Let me think. I remember that in many cultures, there are specific traditions around a baby's first day. In Mexico, I think there's something called ""El Día del Niño"" but wait, isn't that more like a Children's Day celebrated on April 30th? That's not the first day after birth.

Wait, maybe they have a tradition on the first day of the baby's life. Let me recall. Oh, right! In some Latin American countries, including Mexico, the first day is celebrated with a special ritual. The parents might have a small celebration at home, maybe with family and friends. But is there a specific name for this day?

Alternatively, could it be related to the ""Bautizo"" or baptism? But baptism usually happens later, not on the first day. Another thought: in some regions, they have a ""recibimiento"" or welcoming ceremony on the first day. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my knowledge. 

Wait, I think in Mexico, the first day after birth is called ""El Día del Bebé"" or ""Día del Primer Día,"" but I'm not certain if it's a formal holiday. However, families often celebrate the baby's arrival with a gathering, sometimes on the first day, but maybe not a public holiday. However, the user might be referring to a specific tradition. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the ""Día de los Reyes Magos"" which is on January 6th, but that's for giving gifts, not the first day. Hmm. Wait, could it be that in Mexico, the first celebration is on the 1st day, but not a public holiday. So the answer would be that the first day is celebrated on the day of birth itself, but maybe not a specific named holiday. However, I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the ""Bautizo"" as the first celebration, but that's not the first day. I think the answer is that the first day is celebrated on the day the child is born, but there's no specific public holiday for that. However, the family might have a private celebration. But the user might be looking for a specific name or date. 

Wait, I think in some parts of Mexico, they have a tradition called ""La Candelaria"" on February 2",1,,,,1,1.0
Na-ko-33,What symbolic food do people from Mexico eat on (Lunar) New Year?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the symbolic food that people in Mexico eat during Lunar New Year. Hmm, wait a second. Lunar New Year is a holiday celebrated in many East Asian countries like China, Vietnam, Korea, etc. But Mexico is a country in Latin America, so they primarily celebrate the traditional Mexican holidays like Christmas and Día de los Muertos. However, there's a possibility that some Mexican communities might have adopted Lunar New Year customs, especially in areas with significant Chinese or other Asian communities.

But the question specifically mentions Mexico. I need to recall if there's a traditional food associated with Lunar New Year in Mexico. Alternatively, maybe the user is confused between Lunar New Year and another Mexican holiday. For example, in Mexico, during Christmas, they eat pan de villano, but that's not related to Lunar New Year. 

Wait, maybe the question is mixing up the Lunar New Year with another festival. Let me check. Lunar New Year is not a traditional Mexican holiday, so unless there's a specific cultural fusion, there might not be a traditional symbolic food. However, in some parts of Mexico with Chinese communities, they might celebrate Lunar New Year and eat foods like dumplings or other traditional Chinese dishes. But is that considered a symbolic food for Mexican people in general?

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different holiday. For example, in some regions of Mexico, they might have celebrations similar to Lunar New Year, but I'm not sure. Another angle: perhaps the question has a mistake, and it's referring to a different holiday, like the Mexican New Year (Año Nuevo), which is on January 1st. But that's not Lunar New Year. 

In that case, if there's no traditional symbolic food for Lunar New Year in Mexico, the answer might be that they don't have a specific symbolic food for Lunar New Year, as it's not a traditional Mexican holiday. However, if there's a specific food, I need to confirm. Maybe tamales? But tamales are more associated with Christmas and other celebrations in Mexico, not Lunar New Year. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different culture. But the question specifically says Mexico. So perhaps the answer is that there isn't a traditional symbolic food in Mexico for Lunar New Year because it's not celebrated there. But the question is phrased as if there is one. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

New-su-42,What religion is mainly taught in schools in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking what religion is mainly taught in schools in Mexico. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Mexico's official religion is Roman Catholicism. The country has a strong historical connection with the Catholic Church, especially after the Spanish colonization. The Constitution of Mexico does mention Catholicism as the official religion, though there have been amendments over time regarding religious freedom.

Now, considering the education system. In public schools, the curriculum might include religious education, but I need to confirm if it's specifically Catholicism. Some countries have religious education as part of the curriculum, often aligned with the majority religion. However, Mexico's education system has secular policies, but there might be some influence from the Catholic Church in certain aspects. Wait, but I should be careful here. There's a law called the ""Ley General de Educación"" which states that education is secular. However, in practice, some schools might still have Catholic teachings, especially in regions where the Church has a strong presence.

But the main religion taught in schools, if any, would be Catholicism. However, I should check if other religions are also taught. Mexico is becoming more diverse in terms of religion, with increasing numbers of Protestants, Evangelicals, and other faiths. However, the primary one in schools, if there's a main one, is likely Catholicism. But I need to be accurate here. Are there any official policies mandating the teaching of Catholicism in schools?

Wait, the Mexican Constitution was amended in 1917 to establish secular education, and the government has promoted secularism. However, there's a provision that allows religious education in schools, but it's not mandatory. Some schools might offer Catholic education as an option, but it's not the main one taught in all schools. However, given the historical context, Catholicism is still the predominant religion in the country, so it might be the one that's more commonly taught, even if not officially mandated.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no single religion mainly taught, and the education is secular. But I need to verify. If the question is about what religion is mainly taught, and the answer is that secular education is the norm, but Catholicism is the main religion in the country, perhaps the answer is that Catholicism is the main religion taught, even if not as an official curriculum.

Wait, I think in Mexico, religious education is not part of the public school curriculum. The education system is secular, so they don",1,,,,1,1.0
Ne-ar-06,What do people from Mexico eat in Ramadan?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question: ""What do people from Mexico eat in Ramadan?"" Hmm, first, I need to recall if Mexico has a significant Muslim population. I know that Mexico is predominantly Catholic, but there are Muslim communities, especially in cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. However, the majority of Mexicans are not Muslim, so Ramadan is not a widespread observance there.

Now, during Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, and they break their fast with iftar. The traditional foods vary by region and culture. For example, in the Middle East, dates and water are common, while in other parts of the world, there are specific dishes. But since the question is about Mexico, I need to think if there are specific Mexican dishes that are eaten during Ramadan by the local Muslim community.

Wait, but maybe the question is based on a misunderstanding. Since Mexico isn't a country where Ramadan is widely observed, the answer might be that there isn't a specific traditional Mexican cuisine associated with Ramadan. However, Mexican Muslims might follow the same global practices, adapting local ingredients. For example, they might have traditional iftar meals like soups, stews, or dishes such as tamales, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that people from Mexico, who are not Muslim, do not observe Ramadan, so they don't have specific foods associated with it. But the question is about what people from Mexico eat in Ramadan, implying that they do observe it. So maybe the answer is that there aren't specific traditional Mexican foods for Ramadan, but Muslim individuals in Mexico might consume similar dishes to those in other countries, using local ingredients.

Wait, but the user is asking for a list of what people from Mexico eat during Ramadan. If there's no specific Mexican cuisine for Ramadan, the answer would be that they don't have traditional foods for it, but they might eat similar dishes to other Muslim countries, like dates, soups, or other common iftar items. However, since the user wants a list, perhaps the answer is that there are no specific traditional Mexican foods for Ramadan, but the answer should be in a list. However, the user might be expecting that since the question is about Mexico, there's no answer, but the answer should be in a list. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that people from Mexico who observe Ramadan eat similar foods to those in other Muslim-majority countries, but that's not specific to Mexico.",1,,,,,

Ne-ar-26,What is the most famous public corporation in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most famous public corporation in Mexico. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall which companies are well-known in Mexico. Public corporations usually refer to companies that are publicly traded on the stock exchange. Mexico's largest companies by market capitalization might be the answer here.

I remember that Grupo México is a major mining company and one of the largest in Latin America. They have a significant presence in the mining sector. Then there's Cemex, which is a global leader in building materials. Cemex is based in Mexico and has a big international footprint. 

Another possibility is América Móvil, which is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. It's owned by Carlos Slim, a very prominent business figure in Mexico. However, América Móvil is a private company, not a public corporation. Wait, no, actually, América Móvil is a public company listed on the stock exchange, so that's a contender.

Also, there's Banco Nacional de México (Banamex), which is part of the BBVA group. But BBVA is a Spanish bank, so maybe Banamex is considered a major public corporation in Mexico. However, I think Cemex might be more globally recognized. 

Let me check the market capitalization. As of recent years, Cemex has been one of the top companies in Mexico. Grupo México is also large, but perhaps not as globally renowned as Cemex. América Móvil is huge in terms of revenue and operations, but maybe the user is looking for the most famous in terms of brand recognition. 

Alternatively, maybe Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is the most famous, but Pemex is a state-owned enterprise, not a public corporation. The question specifies a public corporation, which is a publicly traded company. So Pemex wouldn't qualify because it's state-owned. 

So between Cemex, Grupo México, and América Móvil. América Móvil is a public company, but perhaps Cemex is more known internationally. I think the answer is Cemex. However, I need to confirm if there's a more prominent one. Another possibility is Walmart de México, but Walmart is a subsidiary of the US-based Walmart Inc., so maybe not as a standalone Mexican public corporation. 

Wait, Grupo México is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange, and they are a major player in mining. But Cemex is also listed and",1,,,,0,0
Ji-ko-36,Which subject’s academy/private educational institute do middle or high students most frequently attend in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Mexico attend most frequently. Let me start by recalling what I know about education in Mexico.

First, Mexico has a public education system, but many students also attend private schools or academies. Private institutes often focus on specific subjects or offer specialized programs. Common subjects that might have private institutes include math, languages, science, or maybe test prep for exams like the ENLACE or the university entrance exams.

Wait, I remember that in many countries, students often take private classes for subjects that are challenging or important for exams. In Mexico, the university entrance exam is highly competitive, so maybe subjects like math, physics, or chemistry are common. Also, language learning, especially English, is popular because it's seen as important for future opportunities.

Another angle: some private institutes might specialize in preparing students for specific exams. For example, there are institutes that focus on SAT, GRE, or other standardized tests. But those might be more for higher education rather than middle or high school. Alternatively, there are academies that teach subjects like Spanish as a second language, but that's more for foreigners.

Wait, the question is about middle or high school students. So, maybe subjects that are part of their curriculum but need extra help. In Mexico, math and science are often emphasized, and students might take private classes in those areas. Also, language subjects like English or French. But which one is the most frequent?

I think in many cases, math is a common subject where students seek private tutoring. However, there's also the possibility of subjects like Spanish, but that's the primary language. Maybe English is more common for private institutes because it's considered a key subject for higher education and careers.

Alternatively, I've heard about ""colegios privados"" that offer comprehensive education, but the question is about academies or institutes that focus on specific subjects. So, it's more likely that students attend institutes that focus on particular subjects rather than full-time private schools.

Looking up some data might help, but since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. In Mexico, there are many private institutes for English, math, and science. However, if I have to choose the most frequent, I think math and English are both strong candidates. But which is more common?

Another thought: in some regions, there might be a higher demand for certain subjects. For example, in areas where the public schools",1,,,,0,0
Th-en-51,Which subject is considered the most important for students in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Mexico. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall the education system in Mexico. From what I know, Mexico's curriculum includes subjects like Spanish, mathematics, science, history, and social studies. But which one is emphasized the most?

I remember that in many countries, math and science are often prioritized because they're seen as foundational for future careers and technological advancement. However, in Mexico, there's a strong emphasis on Spanish as the national language. But wait, isn't Spanish taught from an early age? Maybe it's considered essential for communication and cultural identity.

Another angle: the Mexican education system might place a high value on history and civic education, given their focus on national identity and understanding their past. However, I'm not sure if that's the most important subject overall.

Wait, looking at standardized tests or educational policies might help. For example, the ENLACE or PISA assessments. In PISA, math and reading are key areas. But in Mexico, maybe they prioritize math more? Or perhaps they have specific reforms that highlight certain subjects.

Alternatively, considering the labor market, STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, math) are often promoted as crucial for economic growth. However, in primary education, the core subjects might be different.

Wait, in Mexico's basic education (primaria and secundaria), the main subjects include Spanish, math, natural sciences, social sciences, physical education, etc. But which is the most important? I think Spanish is fundamental for literacy and communication, but math is also critical for problem-solving.

However, the question is about what's considered the most important. Maybe looking at government initiatives. For instance, Mexico has emphasized STEM education in recent years to improve economic competitiveness. But that might be more recent.

Alternatively, historical context: during the 20th century, there was a focus on education reform, but I'm not certain about the specific subjects prioritized.

I need to check if there's any consensus or data. Maybe surveys or educational reports. However, without specific data, I have to rely on general knowledge.

In many Latin American countries, Spanish is the primary subject, but math is also crucial. However, in Mexico, the national curriculum might stress Spanish as the core subject for literacy and cultural preservation. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, math might be considered more important for future opportunities.

New-ch-07,What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what food items people in Mexico typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Mexican cuisine and drinking habits.

First, hard liquors in Mexico might include things like tequila, mezcal, rum, or maybe even some local brandies. Now, when thinking about food pairings, I remember that tequila is often associated with certain snacks. For example, I've heard of people eating guacamole or chips with salsa while drinking tequila. But wait, is that common in Mexico or more of a tourist thing?

Also, there's the tradition of drinking tequila with a salt rim, a lime wedge, and sometimes a chili. That's the ""tequila shot"" method. So maybe the food items are more about those specific accompaniments. But I need to think beyond just tequila. Are there other hard liquors consumed in Mexico that have different pairings?

In some regions, people might drink mezcal, which is similar to tequila but made from different agave. Mezcal is sometimes paired with similar snacks. Then there's rum, which might be used in cocktails like the Cuba Libre, which includes cola and lime. But that's a drink, not a food item.

Also, in Mexico, there's a tradition of drinking alcohol with snacks like tacos, especially street food. So maybe tacos, especially those with spicy fillings, could be paired with hard liquor to balance the heat. Or maybe something like elote (grilled corn) with lime and cheese, which is a common street food.

Another thought: in some cases, people might eat something salty or spicy to complement the strong flavors of hard liquor. So items like chorizo, which is a type of sausage, or maybe some cheese and nuts. Also, I've heard of people eating chocolate with mezcal, which is a popular pairing because the bitterness of the chocolate complements the smoky flavors of mezcal.

Wait, but the question is about ""typical"" pairings. So I need to focus on the most common ones. Let me check if there are any traditional dishes specifically paired with hard liquor. For example, in some regions, they might have certain foods that go with local spirits.

Also, considering the context of social drinking, maybe things like nuts, olives, or dried fruits are common as they are often served with alcohol. But are these typical in Mexico specifically?

Ji-ko-37,What type of clothing do middle and high school students wear to school in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about what clothing middle and high school students in Mexico wear to school. First, I need to think about the general dress code in Mexican schools. I know that in many countries, school uniforms are common, especially in private schools. But I should confirm if that's the case in Mexico.

I remember that in some regions of Mexico, especially in private institutions, students might wear uniforms. However, public schools might have more relaxed policies. But wait, I think even in public schools, there are some dress codes. Maybe they require certain types of clothing like no shorts, skirts below a certain length, or specific colors.

Also, considering cultural aspects, modesty is important. So clothing that's not too revealing. Maybe long pants or skirts, collared shirts, and no open-toed shoes? But I'm not entirely sure. I should check if there's a standard uniform or if it varies by school.

Another point: in some cases, schools might have specific uniforms with school logos or specific colors. But the user is asking for the type of clothing, not necessarily the specific uniform details. So maybe the answer is that students wear formal or semi-formal clothing, avoiding casual wear like tank tops or shorts. Or perhaps it's a mix of uniforms and casual clothes depending on the school.

Wait, I should verify if there's a general trend. From what I recall, many Mexican schools, both public and private, require students to wear uniforms. The uniforms usually include a shirt, pants or skirt, and sometimes a sweater or blazer. But maybe in some schools, especially public ones, the dress code is less strict, allowing casual clothes as long as they're modest.

But the question is about middle and high school, so maybe the answer is that they wear school uniforms, which typically consist of a shirt, pants or skirt, and sometimes a tie or specific colors. However, if the school doesn't have a uniform policy, students might wear casual but modest clothing. But since the user wants a single answer as a list, I need to generalize.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that students wear formal or semi-formal clothing, avoiding overly casual items. But I'm not certain. I think the most accurate answer is that they wear school uniforms, which include specific clothing items, but it's possible that some schools allow casual attire as long as it's appropriate. However, to provide a concise answer, it's best to state the common practice, which is school uniforms with specific guidelines.",1,,,,1,1.0

Gu-ch-08,What is the most popular sports among children in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular sports among children in Mexico. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Mexico. I know that soccer, or fútbol, is huge there. It's the national sport, and the Mexican national team is pretty well-known. So that's probably a top contender.

Then there's baseball. I remember that Mexico has a strong baseball culture, especially in cities like Mexico City. They have a lot of baseball stadiums and leagues. Maybe baseball is also popular among kids.

What about other sports? Basketball might be popular too, especially with the NBA having some Mexican players. But I'm not sure how widespread it is among children compared to soccer and baseball.

Then there's wrestling, but that's more of a spectacle with lucha libre. While it's popular, I'm not sure if it's considered a sport in the same way as soccer or baseball. Maybe it's more of an entertainment thing.

Other sports like volleyball, gymnastics, or even skateboarding might be present, but I don't think they're as dominant. Also, considering the influence of the US, maybe American football or basketball could be growing, but again, not sure about their popularity with children.

Looking up some sources in my mind, I think soccer is definitely the most popular. Then baseball comes in second. Maybe basketball and wrestling are also in the top. But the question asks for the most popular, so maybe just the top ones.

Wait, the user wants a list of the most popular sports. So I should list them in order? But the example given in the JSON just has a list, not ordered. But the question says ""most popular,"" which might imply ranking. However, the user's example answer just lists them without order. Let me check the user's instruction again.

The user says ""Provide one single answer as a list form"" and gives an example where the answer is a list. The example answer is [""answer here""], so they just want the list of sports, not necessarily ordered. But the question is about the ""most popular,"" which might mean the top one or several. However, the user might be expecting multiple sports.

But I need to be accurate. In Mexico, soccer is definitely the most popular. Then baseball is also very popular, especially in certain regions. Lucha libre (wrestling) is a big part of the culture, but is it considered a sport? It's more of a performance, but maybe it's included. Then",1,,,,1,1.0
New-as-20,What is the most popular indoor sport in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Mexico is. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Mexico. Mexico has a rich sporting culture, and they're known for their passion for football (soccer), which is definitely a huge sport there. But the question is about an indoor sport.

Indoor sports can include things like basketball, volleyball, table tennis, maybe even things like boxing or martial arts. But I need to think about which ones are popular specifically indoors. Let me break it down.

Football is primarily an outdoor sport, played on a large field, so that might not count. Then there's basketball. I know that Mexico has a national basketball team, and they have professional leagues. But how popular is it compared to other indoor sports? Maybe volleyball? I'm not sure. There's also indoor soccer, like futsal, which is a variant played indoors. But is futsal more popular than other sports?

Wait, I should check if there's any data or common knowledge about this. From what I remember, Mexico has a strong presence in basketball, with players like Rudy Gay and others playing in the NBA. They have the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional (LNBP) which is their top league. But is basketball more popular than, say, volleyball or table tennis?

Another angle: major events. Mexico City hosts various indoor sports events. For example, the Mexican Basketball League games are held in large arenas. Also, the Mexican national basketball team has participated in international competitions. However, I'm not sure if that translates to being the most popular.

Alternatively, maybe volleyball is more popular. Or perhaps something like boxing, which is often held in indoor arenas. But boxing is more of a combat sport. Then there's table tennis and badminton, but those might not be as mainstream.

Wait, I think in some countries, indoor soccer (futsal) is quite popular. Is that the case in Mexico? Futsal is played on a smaller court, so it's an indoor sport. Mexico has a national futsal team and participates in international competitions. Maybe that's a contender.

But I need to compare the popularity. If I search in my mind for popular indoor sports in Mexico, I might think of basketball and futsal. However, which one is more popular? Let me think about media coverage, number of participants, or spectator numbers.

New-in-01,Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Mexico. Let me start by recalling what I know about coffee culture there. Mexico has a strong tradition of coffee consumption, and there are both international chains and local brands.

First, I know that Starbucks is a big name globally, so they probably have a presence in Mexico. But I'm not sure if they're the most popular there. Then there's Café de Olla, which I think is a Mexican chain. They might be more popular because they're local. Also, there's Starbucks' competitor, like Costa Coffee or maybe even local independent cafes. Wait, but the question is about the most popular brand. 

I should check if there are any surveys or market research data. From what I remember, in some Latin American countries, local brands tend to dominate because of cultural preferences and pricing. Café de Olla is a Mexican chain that's been around for a while, so they might have a significant market share. However, Starbucks might have a larger number of locations, but popularity could be measured by customer preference or market share. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another brand. I think there's also a chain called Starbucks, but I'm not certain if they are the top. Wait, I've heard that in Mexico, Café de Olla is quite popular, especially for traditional coffee. Also, there's a brand called Starbucks, but maybe not the most popular. Let me verify. 

Another angle: looking at online sources or recent articles. If I recall correctly, a 2023 report mentioned that Café de Olla is the leading coffee shop brand in Mexico, followed by Starbucks and other international chains. However, I need to be cautious about the accuracy of that information. Alternatively, maybe it's Starbucks. Wait, I think in some regions, Starbucks is more prevalent, but in Mexico, the local brand might hold more popularity. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In the US, Starbucks is dominant, but in other countries, local brands might be more popular. For example, in Japan, Starbucks is huge, but in some other places, local chains are preferred. Mexico's coffee culture is rich, and they have their own traditions. Café de Olla is a Mexican chain that's been around since the 1980s, so they might have a strong presence. 

I think the answer is Café de Olla, but I'm not 100% sure. However",1,,,,1,1.0

New-en-47,What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Mexico. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many countries, backyards have different features based on climate and culture. Mexico has a warm climate, so maybe they have things like plants that thrive in heat. I've heard about Mexican gardens having lots of greenery. Maybe things like cacti or other desert plants? Also, maybe fruit trees since growing your own fruit is common in many cultures.

Wait, but the question is specifically about back gardens. In some places, people have patios or outdoor living spaces. Maybe in Mexico, they have areas for outdoor dining or relaxation. Also, considering traditional Mexican elements, perhaps there are elements like a small pool or a fountain? Or maybe a chicken coop if they have livestock.

I should also consider common elements in residential backyards. Things like a garden shed, maybe a barbecue area. But I need to focus on what's typical in Mexico. I've seen images of Mexican homes with small gardens, maybe with flowers like marigolds, which are traditional there. Also, maybe a place for a grill or a fire pit.

Wait, but I should avoid assuming. Let me think again. In many Mexican homes, especially in urban areas, backyards might be smaller. However, in rural areas, they might have more space. But the question is about typical, so maybe generalizing. Common elements could include a variety of plants, maybe a vegetable garden for growing food, herbs, or flowers. Also, maybe a small water feature like a pond or a fountain. Another possibility is a shaded area with a table and chairs for outdoor use.

Alternatively, maybe a place for pets, like a dog run. But I'm not sure if that's typical. Also, considering security, maybe a gate or fencing. However, those are more structural and not items found in the garden itself.

Another angle: traditional Mexican gardens might include elements like a palapa (a thatched roof structure), but that's more for outdoor living spaces. Maybe a garden with native plants. Also, some might have a small greenhouse or a place for growing herbs and vegetables.

Wait, but the user wants a single answer in a list. So I need to list one or more items. Let me check if I can find common elements. From what I recall, in Mexican backyards, you often find a variety of plants, maybe fruit trees like mango or avocado, ornamental plants, maybe",1,,,,1,1.0

Sa-en-7,What are popular snacks in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what popular snacks are in Mexico. Let me start by recalling what I know about Mexican cuisine. I know that Mexico has a lot of street food, so maybe those are considered snacks. Tacos come to mind, but are they considered snacks or more of a meal? Maybe they are both. Then there's chips and salsa, which are common. I think tortilla chips are a staple. Also, maybe something like elote, which is grilled corn on the cob. Quesadillas might be another one. Oh, and churros are a popular sweet snack. I've heard of empanadas, but I'm not sure if they're as common in Mexico as in other countries. Maybe some types of candies like dulce de leche or something similar. Also, there's the traditional candy called ""chocolate"" which is a sweet, spiced chocolate. Oh, and maybe some nuts or seeds? I think ""nueces"" are popular. Also, there's a snack called ""tostadas"" which are crispy tortillas with toppings. Another thing is ""pupusas,"" but I think those are more from El Salvador. Wait, maybe ""tlayudas"" are a type of snack. Also, ""carnitas"" are a type of pork, but that might be more of a main dish. I should check if these are indeed considered snacks. Maybe ""al pastor"" is more of a main dish. Let me think of more. There's ""chiles rellenos,"" but again, that's a dish. What about ""tamales""? They might be more of a traditional food but sometimes eaten as a snack. Also, ""pan dulce"" which is sweet bread, like conchas or bolillos. Oh, and ""churros"" are definitely a snack. Maybe ""nachos"" as well, though they're more Americanized. But in Mexico, they might have their own version. Also, ""gorditas"" which are thick tortillas with fillings. I think that's a snack. I should compile a list of these, making sure they are actually popular in Mexico. Let me verify: tacos, chips and salsa, elote, churros, tamales, pan dulce, tostadas, quesadillas, and maybe some candies like ""chocolate"" or ""alegrías."" Also, ""nueces"" (pecans) are a traditional snack. So",1,,,,1,1.0

Kik-in-36,Who is the most popular soccer coach in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular soccer coach in Mexico is. Let me start by recalling some well-known Mexican coaches. There's Javier Aguirre, who has coached the national team before. Then there's Miguel Herrera, who was the head coach of the Mexico national team and is known for his passionate style. Also, there's Gerardo Martino, who has coached clubs like Barcelona and has been involved in Mexican football, though he's from Argentina.

Wait, but the question is about popularity. Popularity can be subjective, but maybe based on recent achievements or media presence. Let me think about recent World Cup campaigns. Mexico's coach during the 2018 World Cup was Juan Carlos Osorio, but he was fired after the tournament. Then there was Ricardo La Volpe, but he was interim. More recently, the current head coach of the Mexico national team as of 2023 is Tata Martino, who is from Argentina but has been coaching in Mexico. However, he might not be considered Mexican.

Wait, maybe I should check who has the most followers on social media or has been in the news more. Also, some coaches are more popular because of their success with clubs. For example, Javier Hernández ""Chicharito"" is a player, not a coach. Then there's Miguel Herrera, who was the coach of the national team and had a lot of media attention. He was known for his fiery personality and was the coach during the 2015 and 2018 World Cup qualifiers. But after that, he stepped down.

Another name is José Manuel de la Torre, but he hasn't been as prominent. Maybe the answer is Miguel Herrera because of his tenure with the national team and his visibility. However, I need to confirm if he's still active or if there's someone more recent. Wait, as of now, the Mexico national team's head coach is Tata Martino, but he's not Mexican. However, the question is about popularity, which might be influenced by national pride. So maybe a Mexican coach who has had success.

Wait, there's also Guillermo Ochoa, but he's a goalkeeper, not a coach. Maybe I should look at club coaches in Mexico. For example, Miguel Herrera has coached Club América, which is a major club. If he's popular for his club success, that might count. Alternatively, there's Javier Aguirre, who has coached both clubs and the national",1,,,,1,1.0

New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Mexico? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Mexico. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Mexican education system. Middle school in Mexico is typically referred to as ""secundaria,"" which is part of the secondary education level. This usually covers students from around 12 to 15 years old.

Now, the question is about the number of subjects taught. I remember that the Mexican curriculum has a set of mandatory subjects. Let me think about the core subjects. There's definitely Spanish, which is the primary language. Then math, science, social studies, maybe history, geography, physical education, art, music, and something like technology or computer skills. Also, there might be a subject called ""Formación Cívica y Ética"" which is about civic education and ethics. That's part of the Mexican curriculum.

Wait, but how many exactly? Let me try to list them out. From what I've read before, the typical subjects in Mexican middle schools include:

1. Spanish (Lengua y Literatura)
2. Mathematics (Matemáticas)
3. Science (Ciencias Naturales)
4. Social Studies (Historia)
5. Geography (Geografía)
6. Physical Education (Educación Física)
7. Art (Artes)
8. Music (Música)
9. Technology or Information Technology (Tecnología or Informática)
10. Civic Education and Ethics (Formación Cívica y Ética)
11. Foreign Language (usually English, Inglés)
12. Maybe another subject like Religion or Optional Electives?

Hmm, but I'm not sure if all states include the same number of subjects. The Mexican education system has some federal guidelines, but states can have variations. However, the basic core subjects are standardized. Let me check if there's a standard number.

I think the official curriculum from the Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) lists around 12 subjects for secondary education. Let me confirm. For example, in some sources, they list subjects like Spanish, Math, Science, History, Geography, Art, Music, Physical Education, Civic Education, Foreign Language, Technology, and maybe one more like ""Exploration and Discovery"" or ""Project-Based Learning."" Wait, maybe that's part of a newer curriculum reform.

Alternatively, some sources might count certain subjects differently. For instance, Science and Technology might be combined, or maybe there's a subject called ""Educación",1,,,,1,1.0

New-en-69,Which writers are commonly studied in literature class in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which writers are commonly studied in literature classes in Mexico. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall the Mexican literary canon. There are several prominent authors from Mexico that are typically included in school curricula.

Starting with the classics, Octavio Paz comes to mind. He was a Nobel Prize winner and a significant figure in Mexican literature. Then there's Jorge Luis Borges, although he was Argentine, he's very influential and might be studied in Mexico too. Wait, but the question is about Mexican writers specifically. Maybe I should focus more on Mexican nationals.

Another important name is Carlos Fuentes. He's a major figure in Latin American literature and definitely taught in schools. Then there's Gabriel García Márquez, but he's Colombian. Hmm, maybe he's included too, but I should check if he's considered in Mexican education. Maybe not as much as Mexican authors.

Rosa Luxemburg? No, she was a political figure, not a writer. Maybe I confused her with someone else. Let me think again. Luis Alberto Urrea is a contemporary writer, but I'm not sure if he's commonly studied. Then there's Elena Poniatowska, a prominent Mexican writer known for her novels and journalism.

Also, the modernist movement in Mexico includes figures like José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, but he's from the 19th century. Maybe the user is looking for more modern authors. Let's see, Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Elena Poniatowska, maybe Mario Benedetti? Wait, he was Uruguayan. I need to be careful with nationalities.

Another name is Juan Rulfo, known for ""Pedro Páramo,"" which is a classic in Mexican literature. That's definitely studied. Then there's Octavio Paz, again. Maybe also José Emilio Pacheco, a poet. Also, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, a historical figure, a nun and writer from the colonial period. She's often included in literature classes because of her significance.

So compiling this list: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Elena Poniatowska, Juan Rulfo, and maybe José Emilio Pacheco. Are there others? Maybe Gabriel García Márquez is sometimes included even though he's Colombian. But I should stick to Mexican authors. Also, maybe José Martínez Estr",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ha-08,What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking about a food that children in Mexico typically dislike but elderly people enjoy. Hmm. I need to think about traditional Mexican foods and which ones might be considered less appealing to kids but more so for older folks.

First, I know that Mexican cuisine has a variety of dishes with different flavors and ingredients. Some dishes are spicy, others are more savory or have strong tastes. Children might not like foods that are too spicy or have complex flavors. On the other hand, the elderly might prefer foods that are more comforting or have a certain texture.

One possibility that comes to mind is ""chiles rellenos."" Wait, no, those are stuffed peppers, usually with cheese or meat. Maybe not. Another thought: ""menudo,"" which is a tripe soup. Tripe is the stomach lining of cows, right? That might be something that kids don't like because of the texture and the strong smell, but older people might enjoy it as a traditional dish. Menudo is often eaten for breakfast and is considered a hearty meal. I've heard that it's a common dish in Mexico, especially in certain regions. The elderly might appreciate the taste and the tradition, while children might find the texture or the smell unappealing.

Alternatively, maybe ""escamoles,"" which are ant egg masses. But that's probably more of a delicacy and not commonly consumed by the elderly either. Or ""churros,"" but those are fried and sweet, so kids might like them. Maybe ""tamales"" but those are usually enjoyed by all ages. 

Wait, ""chiles en nogada"" is another dish, but that's more of a festive dish with a specific time of year. Not sure about that one. 

Another angle: foods that are more pungent or have a strong aroma. Maybe ""salsas"" that are very hot? But again, not sure if that's specific to elderly. 

Menudo seems like the most plausible answer. It's a traditional soup made with tripe, which has a unique texture and strong flavor. Children might not like the texture or the smell, while the elderly might enjoy it as part of their cultural cuisine. I think that's the one. Let me confirm if there's another dish. Maybe ""carnitas"" but that's more of a pork dish that's popular. 

Alternatively, ""pozole,"" which is a hominy soup with pork. It's a traditional dish. But again,",1,,,,0,0
Ji-ko-45,What do people look forward to the most at university festivals in Mexico?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what people look forward to the most at university festivals in Mexico. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what university festivals in Mexico are like. I know that in many countries, university festivals have various activities like music, food, games, and cultural events. But Mexico has its own unique aspects. Maybe traditional music and dance? Like mariachi or folkloric dances? Also, food is a big part of Mexican culture, so maybe traditional dishes are a highlight.

Wait, but the question is about what people look forward to the most. So it's the main attraction. In some festivals, there might be competitions, concerts, or special events. Maybe the main stage performances or guest speakers? Or perhaps the social aspect, like meeting friends and networking.

But I should focus on what's most common in Mexican university festivals. Let me think of specific examples. In Mexico, festivals might include events like ""Feria de las Culturas"" or ""Festival de la Universidad,"" which often feature traditional music, dance, art exhibitions, food stalls, and maybe even contests. So the main attractions could be the cultural performances, especially traditional ones, and the food. 

Another angle: university festivals might have academic competitions or sports events, but I think the cultural and entertainment aspects are more prominent. Also, considering the festive atmosphere, fireworks or special events could be part of it. But I need to be specific. 

Wait, the user wants the answer in a list, but only one answer. Wait, the instruction says ""provide one single answer as a list form"" – maybe they mean a list with one item? Or perhaps they want multiple points but in a single list. The example given in the JSON has a list, so maybe multiple items. But the user says ""one single answer as a list form."" Maybe they mean the answer is a list, but the answer itself is one item. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake, but the example shows a list with one element. 

But back to the question. What's the main thing people look forward to? In many cases, the food is a big draw. Mexico has delicious street food and traditional dishes. So maybe the food stalls and traditional cuisine. Alternatively, the music and dance performances. But which is more prominent? 

I think that in many festivals, the combination of food, music, and cultural activities are all important, but if I have to pick the most anticipated, perhaps the traditional performances and",1,,,,0,0

Ni-en-31,What do people in Mexico traditionally eat on Christmas Day?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking what people in Mexico traditionally eat on Christmas Day. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many Latin American countries, including Mexico, Christmas traditions often include specific foods. I remember that tamales are a common dish during holidays. They're made with masa, filled with things like pork, chicken, or vegetables, and wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves. Then there's pan de villano, which is a type of sweet bread similar to panettone. It's usually eaten around Christmas time.

Also, I think pozole might be part of the meal. Pozole is a traditional Mexican soup with hominy and meat, often pork. It's sometimes associated with Christmas. Another possibility is romeritos, which are a type of salad made with romaine lettuce, beans, and other ingredients, served with a spicy sauce. 

Wait, but I should make sure these are actually traditional for Christmas in Mexico. Maybe I should verify if these are commonly eaten on Christmas Day specifically. Tamales are definitely a staple during Christmas, as they are for other holidays like Day of the Dead. Pan de villano is definitely a Christmas treat. Pozole might be more associated with New Year's, but I'm not sure. Romeritos are sometimes served during Christmas as well. 

I should check if there are other dishes. Maybe bacalao, which is salted cod, but that's more common in Spain and some Latin American countries for Christmas. However, in Mexico, I'm not sure if that's traditional. Alternatively, there might be a specific type of turkey or other meats. But I think the main ones are tamales, pan de villano, and maybe pozole. Romeritos might be part of it too. 

Wait, I need to be precise. Let me recall. In Mexico, Christmas Eve is often a time for a big family meal, which might include tamales, pozole, and other dishes. Christmas Day itself might be more about leftovers or a lighter meal, but I think the main traditional foods are still tamales and pan de villano. Maybe also a type of sweet called ""buñuelos,"" which are fried pastries. But I think the primary answer would include tamales, pan de villano, and possibly pozole. However, the user is asking for a list, so I need to be accurate.
