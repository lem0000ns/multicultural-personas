New-ko-02,What is the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in North Korea. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about North Korea's healthcare and education systems. North Korea has a centralized government, so their policies and programs are likely state-run. Prenatal care is probably emphasized as part of public health initiatives.

I remember that in many countries, prenatal education includes things like classes on nutrition, exercise, childbirth preparation, and infant care. But in North Korea, given their unique circumstances, the approach might be different. They might focus on state-sponsored programs that align with their ideology.

I think North Korea has maternity hospitals and prenatal clinics. Maybe they have specific educational activities organized by the government. There's also the possibility of propaganda or ideological education being part of prenatal classes, promoting loyalty to the regime.

Wait, I've heard that in North Korea, pregnant women might attend classes that combine medical education with political indoctrination. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular activity. Alternatively, maybe it's more about practical aspects like proper nutrition and exercise, which are standard in prenatal care worldwide.

However, given the lack of access to international information and the controlled media environment, the state might have a specific program. I think the most common prenatal education activity in North Korea is attending state-organized prenatal classes that focus on health education, proper nutrition, and possibly political education. But I need to confirm if there's a specific activity that's most popular.

Another angle: the North Korean government might emphasize collective activities, so group classes in community centers or hospitals. Maybe they have workshops on traditional medicine or specific exercises recommended by the state.

Wait, I found in some sources that prenatal education in North Korea includes classes on nutrition, childbirth preparation, and infant care, similar to other countries, but conducted in state-run facilities. However, there's also an emphasis on political education, as the government might use prenatal classes to reinforce loyalty.

But the question is about the most popular activity. If I can't find specific data, I might need to make an educated guess based on common prenatal activities adjusted for North Korea's context. Since the user wants a single answer, I should focus on the most likely one.

Considering that North Korea's healthcare system is state-controlled, the most popular prenatal education activity would likely be attending state-organized prenatal classes that include both medical education and ideological instruction. However, to be precise, maybe the answer is simply attending prenatal classes provided by the government",1,,,,0,0
Ji-ko-29,Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in North Korea's society?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is about which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in North Korea's society.

First, I need to recall what I know about North Korean customs and celebrations. I remember that North Korea has a strong emphasis on leadership and national figures. The birthdays of leaders like Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un are major events. For example, Kim Il-sung's birthday is celebrated as a national holiday, and there are large-scale military parades and public events. Similarly, Kim Jong-un's birthday is also a significant day with various commemorations. However, the question is about an age, not a person. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The user might be referring to the age of the leader when their birthday is celebrated, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick question where the answer is the 100th birthday, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. The user might actually be asking about the age of a person whose birthday is celebrated the most, not the age itself. For example, the birthdays of the leaders are celebrated, and their ages might be considered. But I think the correct answer is that the birthdays of the leaders, particularly Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, are celebrated the most grandly. However, the question specifically asks for an age, like 70th, 80th, etc. But I don't recall specific ages being celebrated more than others. Wait, maybe the 100th birthday of Kim Il-sung? He was born in 1912, so his 100th birthday would be 2012. I think North Korea did have celebrations for that. But the question is about the age's birthday, not the person's birthday. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in phrasing, and the intended question is about the birthdays of the leaders, not the age. But given the question as is, perhaps the answer is the 100th birthday, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the 70th birthday of Kim Jong-un? But I need to verify this. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 100th birthday of the founder, Kim Il-sung, which was a major event. However, without more specific information, I think the most likely answer is that the birthdays of the",1,,,,1,0.3333333333333333

Jod-ch-07,"How long (in hours) on average does it take for people in North Korea to have dinner at a restaurant? (Provide Arabic numerals up to one decimal point (e.g., 2, 3.5) only.)","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how long, on average, people in North Korea take to have dinner at a restaurant. Let me start by breaking down the question.

First, I know that in many countries, the average time people spend at a restaurant for dinner can vary. In some places, it might be a quick meal, while in others, people might linger longer. But North Korea is a unique case because of its strict regulations and limited access to information. 

I should consider factors like the availability of restaurants. In North Korea, most people don't have access to private restaurants. The government controls the economy, and there are state-run facilities. There's something called ""kangari"" which are work units where people live and work, and they might have communal dining areas. But these are more like canteens rather than restaurants. 

However, there are some upscale restaurants in Pyongyang, like the Rajin or Koryo Hotel, which might cater to foreign visitors or high-ranking officials. For the general population, dining out might not be common. So, if someone does go to a restaurant, maybe they have a set time allocated. 

But the question is about the average time taken for dinner. If people are used to communal meals in their work units, maybe they eat quickly. Alternatively, if they do go to a restaurant, perhaps they have a fixed time. However, there's not much data on this. 

I should check if there are any studies or reports. But given the lack of access to North Korea's internal data, it's hard to find exact numbers. Maybe I can infer based on similar contexts. In countries with strict time management, meals might be quicker. For example, in some cultures, dinner is a quick affair. 

But since the question is about a restaurant, maybe the time includes waiting, eating, and leaving. If it's a state-run restaurant, perhaps the time is regulated. However, without specific data, it's speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that people don't typically dine at restaurants, so the average time is not applicable. But the question assumes that people do go to restaurants. 

Given the lack of information, the safest answer might be that there's no reliable data, but if I have to provide a numerical answer, maybe 1.5 hours? Or perhaps 1 hour? But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe in the context of North Korea's structured environment, meals are timed. For example, if they have a",1,,,,1,1.0
New-spme-37,Which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korea's education system and their international student programs.

North Korea is a closed country with strict government control over education and international travel. However, some students do go abroad, often under government sponsorship. The government typically sends students to countries that have diplomatic relations with North Korea, such as China, Russia, or Cuba. The fields of study are likely to be aligned with national priorities.

Common areas of interest for North Korea might include engineering, medicine, or technology, as these are critical for national development. However, I've heard that many North Korean students study in China, particularly in cities like Beijing or Dandong. In China, they might pursue fields like engineering, computer science, or medicine. Another possibility is that they study agriculture or military-related fields, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I remember reading that North Korea sends students to study in countries like Russia and China, and the most common fields are engineering, particularly mechanical or electrical engineering, and maybe medicine. However, there's also a significant number studying in the field of military science or related areas. But I need to confirm which is the most common.

Another angle: North Korea has a focus on science and technology for their military and economic development. So, engineering and computer science might be priorities. However, medical education could also be important for their healthcare system. But which one is more common?

Looking up some sources (even though I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge). From what I know, many North Korean students study engineering, especially in countries like China and Russia. For example, they might study mechanical engineering, civil engineering, or electrical engineering. Alternatively, some might study in the field of information technology or computer science as these are growing areas.

Another point: North Korea has a program where students go to study in other countries, and upon returning, they work in key sectors. The government would prioritize fields that contribute to the country's development. Therefore, engineering is likely a top choice. However, I need to be precise. Some reports suggest that the majority of North Korean students abroad study in engineering, particularly in China. So the answer is likely engineering, but I need to check if there's a more specific field.

Alternatively, maybe it's a broader category like ""engineering and technology."" But the question asks for the profession. So the most common profession would be engineers, specifically",1,,,,1,0.5

Ji-ko-24,What is the most preferred recreational facility among children in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most preferred recreational facility is among children in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korea's culture and available facilities.

First, North Korea is a country with strict government control over many aspects of life, including media, education, and leisure activities. The government promotes certain activities that align with their ideology. For children, education is a big part of their daily routine, but there might be some recreational facilities.

I remember that North Korea has a lot of public parks and playgrounds, especially in cities like Pyongyang. These might be common places where children gather. Also, the government might emphasize physical activities like sports, so maybe sports facilities like stadiums or sports centers are popular. However, I'm not sure if these are the most preferred.

Another angle is the availability of other facilities. Since the country is isolated, maybe they have unique facilities. For example, there are reports of amusement parks or movie theaters, but I don't know if those are accessible to children. Also, the government might prioritize facilities that promote loyalty or education, like museums or cultural centers.

Wait, but the question is about the most preferred. So it's not just what's available but what children actually like the most. However, information about North Korea is scarce, and most data comes from limited sources. There might not be surveys or studies on children's preferences in North Korea.

Alternatively, considering the regime's emphasis on physical fitness and military readiness, maybe sports facilities are prioritized. For example, the Juche Tower or the May 1st Stadium in Pyongyang. But are these places where children go for recreation?

Another thought: in many countries, playgrounds are the most common recreational facilities for children. Given that North Korea has limited resources, maybe playgrounds are the most accessible and thus preferred. However, I'm not certain. There's also the possibility of schools having recreational areas, but that's part of their education system.

I should check if there are any specific facilities known to be popular. For example, the Mangyongdae Children's Park in Pyongyang is a known public park. If that's a place where children go, maybe that's the answer. But is it the most preferred?

Alternatively, maybe the government has built specific recreational centers for children. However, without concrete data, it's hard to say. Since the question asks for the most preferred, and given the lack of information, the safest answer might be public parks or playgrounds, as they are common in",1,,,,1,0.5
Sa-en-22,What is the most famous university in North Korea known for its sports team?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to find out which university in North Korea is most famous for its sports team. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korea's education and sports institutions.

North Korea has several universities, but I'm not very familiar with their sports teams. However, I remember that the country places a strong emphasis on sports, especially in state-sponsored institutions. The most well-known university in North Korea is probably Kim Il-sung University, but I'm not sure if it's known for sports. Alternatively, there's the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, but that's more focused on academics. 

Wait, I think there's a university associated with the Korean People's Army. Maybe the Kim Jong-il University of Physical Education? That sounds like it might be related to sports. But is that a university? Or is it a sports academy? Also, I've heard of the Moranbong Ballet School, but that's for ballet, not a university. 

Another angle: North Korea's sports teams often have state-backed institutions. The most famous sports teams might be affiliated with universities that have strong athletic programs. The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is a private university, but I don't think it's known for sports. 

Wait, maybe the most famous one is the Kim Il-sung University. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, there's the University of Physical Education, which might be the one. Let me check my memory. I think the answer is Kim Il-sung University, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the university that's part of the state's sports system. 

Alternatively, the most famous might be the one that has produced notable athletes. For example, if a university's sports team has won multiple international competitions, that would make them famous. But I don't have specific information on which university that is. 

Wait, I think I've read before that the most famous is the Kim Il-sung University, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the university that's part of the Korean People's Army's sports teams. Since I can't look it up, I'll have to rely on what I remember. I think the answer is Kim Il-sung University, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the Pyongyang University of Physical Education? Maybe that's the one. But I'm not certain. 

Given the information I have, I'll go with Kim Il-sung University as the most famous, but I'm not 10",1,,,,1,1.0
Al-en-19,What is a popular second language for high school students in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what a popular second language is for high school students in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korea's education system and language policies.

First, the official language of North Korea is Korean, specifically the North Korean dialect. But since the country is isolated, I wonder if they teach other languages. I remember that in many countries, English is a common second language, but I'm not sure about North Korea. However, given their limited contact with the outside world, maybe they don't emphasize English as much as other countries.

Wait, I think North Korea has a focus on Russian. Historically, there was a close relationship with the Soviet Union, and Russian might have been taught as a second language. But I'm not sure if that's still the case today. Also, maybe Chinese? Because of the proximity to China, perhaps some students learn Chinese. But I'm not certain about the current curriculum.

I should check if there's any reliable information on this. From what I've read before, North Korea's education system does include foreign languages, but due to political reasons, they might prioritize languages that align with their alliances. Since they have a historical connection with Russia, Russian might still be taught. However, I also recall that in recent years, there might be some exposure to English through limited media or other means, but I don't know if it's a formal part of the curriculum.

Another angle: high school education in North Korea is rigorous and focuses on subjects that support the state's goals. If they're emphasizing international relations or science, maybe they include languages that are useful for those areas. But again, without specific information, it's hard to say.

Wait, I found a source once that mentioned Russian is still taught in schools, though proficiency might be low. Alternatively, some sources suggest that English is being introduced more recently, but I'm not sure how widespread it is. Considering the country's isolation, it's possible that Russian remains the primary foreign language taught, even if not widely spoken fluently.

So, putting this together, the most likely answer is Russian. But I need to be careful. Maybe there's another language? Let me think again. Chinese is spoken in the border regions, but as a second language in high schools? Maybe not as much as Russian. Also, North Korea's Juche ideology might prioritize self-reliance, so perhaps they don't emphasize foreign languages as much as other countries. However, they do have some",1,,,,1,1.0

New-su-24,What sports do parents and children commonly play together in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korea's culture and sports.

First, North Korea has a strong emphasis on physical fitness and sports as part of their national identity. The government promotes sports as a way to build discipline and unity. Common sports there might include things like basketball, soccer, or maybe traditional games.

But the question specifically asks about sports that parents and children play together. So I should think about activities that are family-oriented. In many countries, sports like soccer, badminton, or even simple games like catch are common family activities. However, North Korea might have different traditions.

I remember that in North Korea, they have a lot of emphasis on military-style exercises, but that's more for adults. For families, maybe they have traditional games. There's a game called ""Yut Nori,"" which is a Korean board game, but that's more of a tabletop game, not a physical sport. Another possibility is ""Kite Flying,"" which is a traditional activity, but again, not sure if it's considered a sport.

Wait, maybe they have sports that are promoted by the government for families. For example, they might encourage activities like gymnastics or track and field, but those are more individual. Alternatively, maybe they have family-oriented sports events or games that are part of their physical education programs.

Another angle: in North Korea, the government often organizes mass games and events. Maybe these include family participation. But what specific sports? I'm not sure. Maybe something like tug-of-war, which can involve families. Or maybe they have traditional martial arts, but that's more for individuals.

Alternatively, considering the availability of equipment and infrastructure, soccer might be common because it's accessible. Parents and children could play soccer together in parks or open spaces. Similarly, badminton or table tennis might be played in community centers.

But I need to be careful not to assume. Since I don't have specific data on North Korean family sports, I should consider that the answer might be based on general knowledge of traditional Korean games or sports that are family-friendly. However, without concrete sources, it's challenging. But the user is asking for a single answer, so maybe the most likely answer is soccer, as it's a widely played sport and can be done in groups. Alternatively, maybe they have a specific sport promoted by the government for families.

Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in North Korea's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the required subjects are for the university entrance exam in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about education in North Korea. Their education system is quite different from Western countries, and it's heavily influenced by the government.

First, I remember that the entrance exam is called the ""Koryo Examination"" or ""Koryo Test."" It's a crucial step for students wanting to get into university. But what subjects are tested? In many countries, entrance exams include subjects like math, language, and sometimes science. However, North Korea's curriculum might be different.

I think the main subjects might be Korean language, mathematics, and perhaps a foreign language like English. But wait, I'm not sure if English is actually required. Also, there might be subjects related to political ideology, given the country's emphasis on loyalty to the regime. Maybe something like ""Political Science"" or ""Kim Il-sung Thought"" is part of the exam. However, I'm not certain about this. 

Another angle: North Korea's education system is supposed to be based on the Juche ideology. So, subjects that align with that might be emphasized. But the entrance exam might focus more on traditional academic subjects rather than ideological ones, though it's possible that ideological subjects are included. I should check if there's any reliable information on this.

Wait, I've read before that the entrance exam includes Korean language, mathematics, and a foreign language. However, there's also a possibility that subjects like history or social studies are included. But I need to verify this. Since information about North Korea's education system is limited and often censored, it's challenging to get accurate details. 

Alternatively, considering the structure of other East Asian countries, like China or South Korea, their entrance exams include similar subjects. North Korea might follow a similar pattern but with its own modifications. So, Korean language, math, and maybe a foreign language. However, I'm not sure if the foreign language is mandatory or just recommended. 

Another thought: North Korea might not have a standardized test like the SAT or Gaokao, but instead, the Koryo Examination could be more comprehensive. However, without concrete sources, I can't be certain. It's possible that the required subjects are Korean, math, and a foreign language, but I should be cautious about including ideological subjects unless there's evidence. 

In conclusion, based on available information, the required subjects are likely Korean language, mathematics, and a",1,,,,1,1.0

New-gr-06,What is the most popular food in North Korea among young people?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular food is among young people in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean cuisine. The country's food is influenced by Korean traditions, but due to economic sanctions and limited resources, their diet might be different from what's typically found in South Korea.

I remember that in North Korea, the staple food is usually rice, but because of food shortages, they might rely more on corn or potatoes. However, the question is about young people's preferences. Maybe they have access to more varied foods through markets or black markets? Or perhaps there's a trend towards certain dishes.

Wait, I think there was some information about Pyongyang's markets. Young people might prefer dishes that are more accessible or trendy. Also, considering the influence of Chinese cuisine, maybe dishes like kimchi or other fermented foods are popular, but I'm not sure if that's specific to youth.

Another angle: North Korea's propaganda might promote certain foods as part of their culture. However, the actual consumption might differ. Maybe street foods or snacks are more common among younger people. For example, something like hot dogs or other Western-style foods, but I'm not certain if those are available.

Alternatively, traditional dishes like kimchi, bibimbap, or naengmyeon (cold noodles) might be popular, but again, I need to check if these are commonly consumed by the youth. Also, considering the economic situation, affordability is a factor. Perhaps cheaper, more filling foods like rice porridge (juk) or corn-based dishes.

Wait, I think I've heard that in recent years, there's been a rise in the popularity of ""pyongyang-style"" hot dogs, which are a local version of Western fast food. These might be more accessible in certain areas and preferred by younger people. However, I'm not entirely sure if this is accurate or if there's another dish.

Another thought: North Korean youth might have a preference for snacks like chocolate or candy, but those might be considered luxury items. Alternatively, maybe they favor certain side dishes or street foods that are more available.

I need to verify if there's a consensus on this. Since I can't access current data, I'll have to rely on what's been reported. From what I recall, some sources suggest that young people in North Korea might prefer Western-style foods like hot dogs or pizza, but these are often sold in state-run markets and might be more of a novelty.

Ne-ar-36,What is a typical festive meal in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about a typical festive meal in North Korea. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall what I know about North Korean cuisine and their festivals.

I remember that North Korea has a lot of traditional dishes influenced by Korean culture. Common dishes include things like kimchi, which is a staple in Korean meals. But for festive occasions, maybe there are specific dishes they prepare.

I think during festivals, they might have more elaborate meals. One thing I recall is that Pyongyang, the capital, might have special dishes. Also, the government often emphasizes certain foods during public events. For example, they might have a dish that's a combination of different ingredients, like a stew or a rice dish.

Wait, there's a dish called ""Naengmyeon,"" which is cold noodles, but I'm not sure if that's specifically festive. Another possibility is ""Kimchi stew"" or ""Kimchi jjigae,"" which is a popular dish. However, during festivals, they might have more celebratory items like ""Songpyeon,"" which are rice cakes filled with ingredients like sesame seeds or beans. Those are traditionally eaten during Lunar New Year, which is a major festival.

Also, considering the political aspects, the government might promote certain dishes as part of national identity. So, maybe dishes that are considered traditional and symbolic. Another thought is ""Bibimbap,"" but that's more of a everyday dish. 

Wait, I think during major holidays like the Day of the Sun (Kim Il-sung's birthday) or the Korean Revolution Day, they might have special meals. But I need to be specific. The user is asking for a typical festive meal, so maybe the most common one is Songpyeon, especially during Chuseok or Lunar New Year. Alternatively, there's ""Hwanghwadeok,"" which is a sweet glutinous rice cake, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the typical festive meal includes dishes like kimchi, rice, and various meat dishes, but I need to be more precise. Since the user wants a single answer in a list, perhaps the main dish is Songpyeon, and other traditional dishes like kimchi and rice. However, I need to confirm if there's a specific meal that's most commonly associated with festivals in North Korea.

Another angle: North Korea's state media often shows communal meals with dishes like ""Guk"" (soup) and ""Jeongguk"" (stir",1,,,,1,1.0

Th-en-37,"At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in North Korea? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out at what age children typically become independent from their parents in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean society and family structures.

First, North Korea is a highly collectivist society with strong state control over many aspects of life, including education and employment. The government plays a significant role in the upbringing and education of children. I remember that children in North Korea are required to attend school, and the education system is state-run. They have a 12-year compulsory education system, which includes primary and secondary education. However, becoming independent might not just be about finishing school.

In many countries, becoming independent might involve finishing education, getting a job, and living on one's own. But in North Korea, the state controls employment, so maybe after finishing education, they are assigned jobs. But when does that typically happen? Let me think about the education timeline. If school is 12 years, maybe they finish at around 18? But in some places, like South Korea, people might stay in school longer, but in North Korea, perhaps they leave earlier?

Wait, but I should check if there's any specific information on when North Korean children are expected to leave their parents' homes. I know that in some cultures, children might stay with parents until marriage, but in North Korea, marriage age might be different. The government might encourage early marriages or have specific policies. However, I'm not sure about the exact age.

Alternatively, maybe after completing their education, which is around 18, they start working and might live with their parents until marriage. But in many societies, even after finishing education, people live with parents until they get married. However, in some cases, especially in more traditional societies, children might stay with parents longer. But North Korea is a totalitarian state, so maybe the government has policies that require them to move out after a certain age?

Wait, I think I've read somewhere that in North Korea, children are expected to leave their parents' homes after completing their education, which is around 18 years old. However, there might be variations based on the situation. But since the question is asking for the typical age, I need to find the most common answer. However, I might not have exact data here. Let me think again. If the education is 12 years, primary school is 6 years, then secondary is 6 years, so up to 12 years old? Wait, no",1,,,,0,0
Na-ko-39,What is typically given as a congratulatory gesture when attending a friend's wedding in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what is typically given as a congratulatory gesture at a friend's wedding in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean culture and traditions.

First, I know that North Korea has a unique set of customs influenced by its Juche ideology and traditional Korean practices. Weddings in North Korea are likely to be formal events with specific rituals. However, I'm not very familiar with the exact practices, so I need to think carefully.

In many East Asian cultures, gifts such as money, food, or symbolic items are common. But in North Korea, due to economic restrictions and the regime's policies, material goods might be limited. Also, the government might have specific guidelines on such occasions.

Another angle: in North Korea, public displays of loyalty to the regime are important. Maybe the congratulatory gestures are tied to that. However, the question is about a friend's wedding, which is a personal event. So perhaps it's more about traditional gifts rather than political symbols.

I remember that in some Korean traditions, red envelopes with money are given, but I'm not sure if that's the case in North Korea. Also, considering the economic situation, maybe it's more about giving food or household items. Alternatively, since the country has strict controls on foreign goods, the gifts might be local products.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the guests might give a gift to the newlyweds, such as a set of household items, or maybe a symbolic gift like a traditional Korean robe or something related to fertility and prosperity.

Alternatively, since North Korea has a collectivist society, maybe the gift is something that benefits the couple's new household, like a gift card for food supplies or a contribution to their home. However, without specific knowledge, this is speculative.

I need to check if there's any reliable information on North Korean wedding customs. But since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on general knowledge. In many East Asian countries, including South Korea, red envelopes (hongbao) are common, but North Korea's practices might differ. Given the political context, maybe there's an emphasis on gifts that align with state values, but again, this is uncertain.

Alternatively, considering the strict social hierarchy, the gift might be something that shows respect to the couple and their families, perhaps through traditional items or food. However, without concrete examples, it's challenging.

Ji-ko-35,What is the most common form of private education in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the most common form of private education in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about education in North Korea.

First, I know that North Korea has a state-controlled education system. The government heavily regulates all aspects of education, and private education might be limited. But the question is about private education, so I need to think if there are any forms that exist despite the state control.

I remember hearing that in some countries with strict education systems, private tutoring or ""hagwons"" are common, but I'm not sure about North Korea. Wait, North Korea's education system is highly centralized, and the government promotes ideological education. Maybe private education isn't really allowed, but perhaps there are some unofficial or underground methods?

Alternatively, maybe there are religious schools or other institutions, but North Korea is an atheist state, so religion is suppressed. So religious education is probably not a factor.

Another angle: maybe after-school programs or private lessons within the state system. But are these considered private education? Or is the entire system state-run, making private education non-existent?

Wait, I should check if there's any information on private education in North Korea. From what I recall, North Korea's education is strictly state-run, and private education is not permitted. However, some sources might mention that in recent years, there might be some changes, but I don't have specific data.

Alternatively, maybe there are private schools for foreign nationals or international schools, but those would be for expatriates, not the general population. The question is about the most common form, so if those are rare, they might not be the answer.

Another possibility: the government might have some private initiatives, but given the political structure, it's unlikely. The most common form would probably be state-run, but the question specifically asks about private education. If there's no private education, the answer might be that there is none, but the question implies that there is a common form.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. In some contexts, private education could refer to self-study or informal learning, but that's not really an institution. Alternatively, maybe there are some private tutors, but again, under strict government oversight.

I think the safest answer here is that private education is not common in North Korea, and the state controls all education. However, since the question asks for the most common form, perhaps the answer is that there is no significant private education, but the user might expect a different",1,,,,1,0.6666666666666666

New-su-42,What religion is mainly taught in schools in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what religion is mainly taught in schools in North Korea. Let me think about this.

First, I know that North Korea is a country with a strong emphasis on state ideology. The government there is led by the Workers' Party of Korea, and they promote a specific set of beliefs. I remember that North Korea officially supports Juche, which is a political ideology emphasizing self-reliance. But is Juche considered a religion?

Wait, Juche is more of a political philosophy rather than a religion. However, the North Korean government does incorporate elements of religion into their teachings, but not in the traditional sense. They have their own version of communism, and they might reject other religions like Christianity or Buddhism. 

I should check if there's an official state religion. From what I recall, North Korea doesn't have an official religion. Instead, they promote the Juche ideology as the central belief system. In schools, the curriculum would focus on Juche, the leadership of the Kim family, and the goals of the Workers' Party. They might also teach about the ""Songun"" policy, which prioritizes the military.

But the question is about religion. Since Juche is a state ideology, not a religion, maybe the answer is that no specific religion is taught, but rather the state ideology. However, sometimes state ideologies can be conflated with religious teachings in such contexts. Alternatively, the government might not teach any religion, and instead, students are taught about the state's beliefs and history.

Wait, I think North Korea does not teach any organized religion in schools. Instead, they emphasize the Juche ideology and the cult of personality around the Kim family. So the answer would be that the main thing taught is the Juche ideology, but since the question asks about religion, perhaps the answer is that no religion is officially taught, but the state ideology is promoted. However, the user might be looking for Juche as the answer even though it's not a religion. Alternatively, maybe they consider Juche as a form of state religion.

Hmm, I need to be careful here. The correct answer is that North Korea does not have an official religion. The state promotes Juche as the guiding ideology, but it's not a religion. However, in the context of the question, if the options are limited, maybe the answer is that the main thing taught is the Juche ideology. But the question specifically asks about religion. So perhaps the answer is that no religion is taught; instead",1,,,,,

Al-en-39,What do people eat on their birthday in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, I need to find out what people eat on their birthday in North Korea. Let me start by recalling any information I have about North Korean culture and cuisine. I know that North Korea has a unique culture influenced by Korean traditions, but also with some differences due to political and economic factors.

First, birthdays in many East Asian countries often involve specific foods. For example, in South Korea, people eat rice cakes (tteok) on birthdays, which symbolize longevity. I wonder if North Korea has similar traditions. However, due to the country's isolation and different political environment, there might be variations.

I should check if there are any official sources or cultural practices. North Korea's government promotes certain national dishes, like kimchi, but I'm not sure about birthday-specific foods. Also, considering the economic situation, access to certain ingredients might be limited, which could influence what's commonly eaten.

Another angle is the celebration of birthdays. In some cultures, specific dishes are prepared to mark the occasion. For instance, in China, longevity noodles are eaten on birthdays. Maybe North Korea has something similar, but I need to confirm.

I should also consider if there are any unique North Korean dishes that are associated with birthdays. I know that they have dishes like Pyongyang-style hot pot, but I don't know if that's tied to birthdays. Another possibility is that they might follow traditional Korean customs, so maybe the same as in South Korea but with local variations.

Wait, but I need to be accurate. I shouldn't assume. If there's no specific information, maybe the answer is that there's no distinct traditional dish, but people might eat regular meals or have family gatherings with food. However, I should verify this.

Looking up some references (if I could), but since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I think in North Korea, birthdays might not have a specific traditional dish, but families might prepare special meals. However, considering the scarcity of resources, it might be more modest. Alternatively, the government might encourage certain foods as part of national celebrations.

Alternatively, maybe they have a dish called ""Songpyeon"" which is similar to rice cakes, eaten during festivals. But I'm not sure if that's specific to birthdays. Another possibility is that they eat chicken, which is a common celebratory food in some cultures.

Wait, but without concrete information, I should be cautious. The safest answer might be that there's no distinct traditional dish, but people might eat regular meals or",1,,,,1,1.0

Ji-ko-36,Which subject’s academy/private educational institute do middle or high students most frequently attend in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is about which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in North Korea attend most frequently.

First, I need to recall what I know about education in North Korea. North Korea has a highly centralized education system, and the government controls most aspects of education. Private institutions might be limited, but there might be some specialized academies.

I remember that in many countries, especially those with strong emphasis on certain subjects, students might attend private institutes for subjects like mathematics, science, or languages. But in North Korea, the regime places a lot of emphasis on subjects that align with their ideology, like the Korean language, history, and maybe science and math for technical fields.

Wait, but the question is about private or academy institutes. However, North Korea's education system is mostly state-run, so private institutes might be rare. But maybe there are some specialized academies, like the Kim Il-sung University or other institutions focused on specific subjects. Alternatively, maybe there are institutes for military or political education, which are state-run but could be considered similar to academies.

Another angle: in countries with strict education systems, students might attend private institutes for subjects that are not covered adequately in state schools, but in North Korea, the state curriculum is very strict. However, for subjects like mathematics and science, which are important for technical careers, there might be more specialized institutes.

Wait, but the question says ""private educational institute."" However, in North Korea, private education might be restricted. The government might not allow private institutions for most subjects. But perhaps there are some state-run academies that are considered similar to private institutes, like the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, but that's more of a state-run institution.

Alternatively, maybe the most common subject is the Korean language or political science, as these are core in the curriculum. However, the question is about academies or private institutes. If private institutes are rare, maybe the answer refers to state-run academies.

Alternatively, considering that in some contexts, students might attend specialized schools for subjects like music, sports, or science, but again, these are likely state-run.

Wait, I think I've heard that in North Korea, students might attend private institutes for subjects like English, but given the government's stance on foreign languages, that might not be allowed. Alternatively, maybe science and math, but again, not sure.

Th-en-51,Which subject is considered the most important for students in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in North Korea. Hmm, I need to think about the educational priorities in North Korea.

First, I know that North Korea's education system is heavily influenced by the state's ideology. They emphasize loyalty to the leadership, particularly the Kim family. So, subjects that reinforce this ideology might be prioritized. 

In schools, there's probably a strong focus on subjects like Korean history, which would include the history of the Korean Peninsula and the role of the North Korean government. Also, political education would be crucial. They might have courses on Juche ideology, which is the state's official philosophy emphasizing self-reliance and the leadership of the Workers' Party.

Science and math might be important too, but maybe not as much as the ideological subjects. However, I should check if there's any specific subject that's highlighted more. Wait, the North Korean curriculum includes a lot of political education, so subjects like ""Social Studies"" or ""Political Theory"" could be the main ones. But I need to be precise. 

I recall that in North Korea, the study of the leader's works is mandatory. So, maybe the most important subject is one that combines political ideology and loyalty to the regime. Perhaps ""Political Education"" or ""Ideological Studies"" is the primary subject. However, the exact name might be different. 

Alternatively, since the state promotes the Juche ideology, the subject that teaches this ideology might be the most important. But I need to confirm. Maybe the answer is ""Political Education"" or ""Ideological Education."" However, I think the official term used in their curriculum is ""Political and Ideological Education,"" but the user might expect a more general answer. 

Wait, looking at some sources, North Korean schools emphasize subjects that align with the state's goals, which include political loyalty, military preparedness, and the history of the Korean revolution. So, the most important subject would be the one that teaches the state's ideology and loyalty to the leadership. Therefore, the answer is likely ""Political Education"" or ""Ideological Education."" However, I need to make sure there's no more specific subject. 

Another angle: in many countries, the most important subject is often considered to be the one that's most emphasized in the curriculum. In North Korea, the most emphasized subject would be the one that reinforces the regime's authority. So, the answer is probably ""Political Education"" or ""Ide",1,,,,1,1.0
New-ch-07,What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what food items people in North Korea typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean cuisine and their drinking habits.

First, North Korean food is often influenced by Korean traditions, which include dishes like kimchi, rice, and various meats. However, due to economic sanctions and limited resources, their diet might be more limited compared to other countries. They might rely on staple foods like rice, soybeans, and vegetables. 

Hard liquor in North Korea could include things like soju, which is a popular Korean spirit. But I'm not sure if they have other types of hard liquor. When people drink hard liquor, they often pair it with snacks or dishes that can complement the strong flavor. In many Asian cultures, salty or spicy foods are common with alcohol because they can balance the taste.

In North Korea, traditional side dishes (banchan) are usually served with meals. These might include things like kimchi, pickled vegetables, or fermented soy products. However, when drinking hard liquor, maybe they have specific snacks. I've heard that in some contexts, people might eat something like dried seafood, nuts, or even spicy foods to go with alcohol. 

But considering the economic situation, maybe they use more readily available items. For example, kimchi is a staple, so that might be common. Also, maybe they have dishes like Pyongyang-style cold noodles, but that's more of a meal. For pairing with liquor, perhaps they have simpler items like salted fish, soybean paste, or even rice cakes. 

I should also consider if there are any traditional snacks specifically meant for drinking. In some countries, they have specific appetizers or snacks for alcohol. However, I'm not sure about North Korea. Maybe they use similar items to other East Asian countries, like gherkins, pickled radishes, or seaweed. 

Another angle: North Korea might have limited access to certain ingredients, so they might rely on what's most available. Rice is a staple, so maybe they eat rice with liquor. But rice is more of a main dish. Maybe they have small portions of kimchi or other pickled vegetables. 

Also, considering that hard liquor is strong, they might pair it with something savory and salty to cut the alcohol's intensity. So, maybe things like salted fish, seaweed, or soy-based products. 

Putting this all together, the most likely answer would include traditional Korean side dishes that are salty",1,,,,1,0.5

New-spme-05,What are the most popular sweets in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most popular sweets in North Korea. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about North Korean cuisine. I know that due to economic sanctions and limited resources, the variety of sweets might be more restricted compared to other countries. However, there are some traditional sweets that are well-known.

I remember that ""songpyeon"" is a traditional Korean sweet, but wait, isn't that more of a rice cake? Maybe it's sometimes considered a sweet. Also, there's ""hotteok,"" which is a sweet pancake filled with brown sugar, honey, and nuts. But I'm not sure if that's commonly available in North Korea.

Another possibility is ""dalgona,"" which is a honeycomb candy made from sugar and honey. However, I think dalgona is more of a Korean snack rather than a sweet. Then there's ""kongguksu,"" which is a sweet made from chestnuts and honey, but I'm not certain about its popularity in North Korea specifically.

Wait, maybe I should focus on sweets that are more traditional and accessible in North Korea. ""Songpyeon"" is a traditional Korean sweet, but I'm not sure if it's the most popular there. Also, ""sikhye"" is a sweet rice drink, but that's a beverage, not a solid sweet.

Alternatively, there's ""honey candy"" or ""honeycomb candy,"" which might be more common. Another thought: ""pajeon"" is a type of pancake, but that's savory. Maybe ""makgeolli,"" but that's a rice wine, not a sweet.

Wait, perhaps I should check if there are any specific sweets that are known to be produced in North Korea. Considering the country's limited access to imported goods, they might rely on traditional recipes. ""Songpyeon"" is made during holidays, but is it considered a sweet? It's more of a rice cake with sweet fillings.

I think the answer might be that the most popular sweets are traditional ones like songpyeon, hotteok, and dalgona. However, I need to verify if these are indeed popular in North Korea or if they are more associated with South Korea. Since the user is asking about North Korea, I should focus on what's traditionally available there. Maybe ""sikhye"" is more common as a drink, but the user asked for sweets, so solid ones.

New-gr-58,Which job is considered underpaid in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which job is considered underpaid in North Korea. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about North Korea's economy and labor conditions. North Korea has a centrally planned economy, and the government controls most aspects of employment. Wages are determined by the state, and there's a hierarchy in job roles. 

I remember that in many countries, certain professions like teachers, healthcare workers, or public servants might be underpaid, but in North Korea, the situation might be different. However, there's a common perception that jobs in the service sector or those considered less critical to the state's priorities might not be well-compensated. 

Wait, there's also information about the ""special economic zones"" or ""market economy"" areas where people work in informal sectors. Maybe those jobs are underpaid compared to state jobs? But the question is about jobs considered underpaid, not necessarily the informal sector.

Another angle: North Korea's labor policies emphasize loyalty and ideological commitment. Jobs that are seen as essential for the regime, like military or political roles, might have better pay or benefits, while others might not. However, I'm not sure about specific professions. 

Wait, I think there's a common belief that teachers and healthcare workers are underpaid in many countries, but in North Korea, maybe it's different. Alternatively, there's a mention of workers in the textile industry or other state-run factories. However, I need to verify if there's a specific job that's widely recognized as underpaid.

Alternatively, considering the strict class system, perhaps people from lower social classes or those in certain roles are underpaid. But the question is about the job itself, not the person's social status.

Wait, I think I've read before that in North Korea, jobs in the service sector, such as waiters or shop assistants, are considered low-paying compared to other professions. But I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that agricultural workers are underpaid since farming is a lower-status job in many societies, including North Korea.

Alternatively, maybe workers in the construction sector, especially those involved in building infrastructure for the state, but I'm not sure if they are underpaid or if they receive state benefits.

Wait, I should check if there's any reliable source or common knowledge about this. From what I recall, in North Korea, the government provides basic necessities to citizens, but salaries vary. However, certain jobs might not be as lucrative. For example,",1,,,,1,1.0

Okay, I need to figure out the family-related holidays in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean holidays. The main public holidays there include events related to their leaders, like the birthdays of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and the Day of the Sun, which is Kim Jong-un's birthday. But the user is asking specifically about family-related holidays.

Wait, maybe some holidays have family aspects. For example, the Lunar New Year, which is a major holiday in many East Asian countries, including North Korea. They might celebrate it with family gatherings. Also, there's the Chuseok, which is similar to the Korean Harvest Moon Festival, but I'm not sure if that's observed in North Korea. Another possibility is the Day of the Foundation of the Korean People's Army, but that's more about military than family.

Wait, I should check if there are any holidays explicitly focused on family. The Day of the Sun is Kim Jong-un's birthday, which is a big deal, but is that family-related? Maybe not directly. Then there's the Day of the Victory of the Fatherland Liberation War, which commemorates the Korean War, but again, not family-specific.

Another angle: in some countries, there's a Parents' Day or Family Day. Does North Korea have such a holiday? I'm not sure. Maybe the Day of the Korean People's Army is not related. Alternatively, the Spring Festival (Seollal) is a traditional Korean holiday, but I don't know if North Korea observes it as a public holiday. 

Wait, North Korea does celebrate the Lunar New Year, which is a family-oriented time. They might also have holidays related to children, like Children's Day. Let me think. Children's Day is observed in some countries, but I'm not certain if it's a public holiday in North Korea. 

Alternatively, the Day of the Korean People's Army is on February 8th, but that's military. Maybe the answer is that there are no specific family-related holidays beyond traditional ones like Lunar New Year, which might be observed. However, I need to be accurate. Since I can't look it up, I'll have to rely on what I know. 

In North Korea, the main public holidays are:

- Day of the Sun (Kim Jong-un's birthday)
- Day of the Foundation of the Korean People's Army (February 8)
- Day of the Victory of the Fatherland Liberation War (July 2",1,,,,1,1.0
Sa-en-7,What are popular snacks in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what popular snacks are in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean cuisine. They have a lot of dishes that are similar to Korean food in general, but with some differences due to economic factors and available resources.

First, I know that Pyongyang is the capital, and there might be specific snacks there. Kimchi is a staple in Korean cuisine, but I'm not sure if it's considered a snack or a side dish. Maybe there are other things. Then there's the famous Pyongyang-style hot dogs, which I've heard about before. Those are probably a popular snack, especially in cities.

Another thing is the use of corn. Corn is a common crop in North Korea, so corn-based products might be popular. Cornbread or corn cakes could be snacks. Also, there's a snack called ""pajeon,"" which is a type of pancake, but I'm not sure if that's a snack or a main dish.

I should also consider street food. In many countries, street vendors sell snacks like fried dumplings or grilled meats. Maybe North Korea has similar items. However, due to sanctions and limited resources, some snacks might be more basic. For example, dried seaweed or nuts could be common.

Wait, I remember hearing about ""songpyeon,"" which is a traditional rice cake, but that's more of a festive food. Maybe not a daily snack. Then there's ""naengmyeon,"" which is cold noodles, but again, that's a meal, not a snack.

Another possibility is ""tteok,"" which are various types of Korean rice cakes. Some forms might be eaten as snacks. Also, ""gimbap"" is a rice roll, but again, more of a meal. 

I think the key points are Pyongyang hot dogs, corn-based snacks, and maybe some traditional items like rice cakes or pancakes. However, I need to make sure these are actually popular as snacks and not just as part of meals. Since information on North Korea's food culture is limited, I should focus on the most commonly mentioned items.

So, compiling this, the answer might include Pyongyang hot dogs, corn cakes, and maybe some other traditional snacks. I should check if there are other well-known snacks. Maybe ""bindaetteok"" (mung bean pancakes) or ""jeon"" (fried dishes), but I'm not certain if these are considered snacks. 

Given the constraints, the safest answers are Pyongyang hot dogs",1,,,,1,0.6666666666666666
Ta-pe-29,Which professional sport is the highest paying in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which professional sport is the highest paying in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in North Korea. First, I know that North Korea is a country with a centrally planned economy, and the government has significant control over all aspects of life, including sports. 

Professional sports in North Korea might not be as commercially driven as in other countries. The government likely promotes sports that align with their propaganda goals, such as showing strength and discipline. Sports like football (soccer), basketball, and weightlifting are popular there. However, I need to think about which of these might be the highest paying.

Wait, but in North Korea, the concept of ""professional sports"" might be different. Athletes might be state-sponsored, and their salaries could be determined by the government rather than market forces. So maybe the highest paying sport is the one that the government invests the most in, perhaps to showcase their achievements on the international stage.

I remember that North Korea has a strong presence in sports like weightlifting and wrestling. They've had athletes win medals in the Olympics. But are those athletes paid more than others? Alternatively, maybe sports that are more visible in state media are given more funding. 

However, I also need to consider that in North Korea, the economy is not based on market principles, so the idea of ""highest paying"" might not directly translate to salaries in the same way as in capitalist countries. It could be that the government provides stipends or benefits to athletes, but the structure isn't clear. 

Another angle: perhaps there are no professional leagues in the traditional sense. Instead, athletes might be part of the military or state-run teams. If that's the case, their compensation might not be based on performance or market demand but on state allocation. 

I'm not sure if there's any reliable data on athlete salaries in North Korea. Given the lack of transparency, it's hard to know. However, considering the government's emphasis on certain sports for propaganda, it's possible that sports like football or wrestling are prioritized, but I don't have concrete evidence.

Wait, but the user is asking for the highest paying. If there's no professional sports industry as we know it, maybe the answer is that there are no professional sports, or that the government doesn't have a formal system of paying athletes. However, the question assumes that there is a professional sport with varying pay. 

Alternatively, maybe the highest paying is a sport that's state-supported,",1,,,,1,1.0
Kik-in-36,Who is the most popular soccer coach in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular soccer coach in North Korea is. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean soccer. North Korea has a national team that's participated in various international tournaments, like the FIFA World Cup. Their football system is state-run, so the coaches are probably appointed by the government.

I remember that the North Korean national team had some success in the past, like reaching the quarterfinals of the 1966 World Cup. But I'm not sure about recent coaches. Maybe I should think about the current or recent coaches. Let me try to recall any names. There's a coach named Kim Jong-gil, but I'm not sure if he's the most popular. Wait, there's also a coach named Park Jang-soo, but I think he was involved in some controversies. 

Wait, another name that comes up sometimes is Ri Yong-ho. He was the head coach of the national team for a while. But is he the most popular? I'm not certain. I should check if there are any other prominent coaches. Also, considering that North Korea's media is state-controlled, the most popular coach might be the one who has led the team to notable achievements or has been in the spotlight for a long time. 

Another angle: maybe looking at the current head coach. As of recent years, I think the head coach might be Kim Il-sung, but that seems too coincidental with the leader's name. Wait, no, that's probably not right. Maybe I'm mixing up names. Alternatively, there's a coach named Kim Jong-hun. I'm getting confused here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the most popular is the one who was in charge during the 2010 World Cup qualifiers or other significant events. I might need to verify, but since I can't access current data, I'll have to rely on what I remember. Another possibility is that the most popular coach is the one who has been with the team for the longest time or has the most media presence. 

Wait, I think the current head coach as of recent years is Kim Jong-gil. He was appointed in 2019. However, popularity might not just be based on current position but also on achievements. If he's led the team to some successes, he might be the most popular. Alternatively, maybe a former coach who had more success.

Jo-sp-13,What is the most popular water sport in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular water sport in North Korea is. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korea and their sports. North Korea is a country that's pretty isolated, so information about their sports might be limited. I know that they have a strong focus on certain sports, especially those that can showcase their achievements, like weightlifting, gymnastics, and maybe some team sports like football (soccer) or basketball. But water sports?

Water sports could include things like swimming, rowing, sailing, maybe even something like water polo. But I don't remember hearing much about North Korea participating in or promoting water sports. They do have a lot of propaganda around their athletes, but I think their focus is more on land-based sports. For example, they have a lot of Olympic medalists in weightlifting and wrestling.

Wait, maybe they have a lot of rivers or lakes? North Korea has the Yalu River and the Taedong River. Maybe they have some rowing or canoeing? But I don't know if that's popular. Alternatively, maybe they have a lot of swimming events. However, considering the country's infrastructure, access to swimming pools and other water sports facilities might be limited. Also, the climate could be a factor. North Korea has a temperate climate, so maybe swimming is possible during warmer months, but not sure if it's a popular sport.

I should check if there are any notable North Korean athletes in water sports. I can't recall any. They might participate in international competitions, but maybe not in large numbers. Their main focus is on sports where they can win medals to boost national pride. Since water sports might not be their strong suit, perhaps they aren't as popular.

Another angle: maybe the government promotes certain sports. If they have a lot of military or physical training, maybe swimming is part of that. But I don't think that's considered a ""popular"" sport in the way that, say, football is in other countries. Without specific data or sources, it's hard to say. However, given the lack of information and the country's emphasis on other sports, it's possible that there isn't a widely recognized popular water sport. Maybe the answer is that there isn't a prominent one, but the question asks for the most popular, so perhaps the answer is swimming, even if it's not widely known. Alternatively, maybe they have a lot of fishing, but that's not a sport.

Na-ko-29,Who is the most famous swimmer in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking who the most famous swimmer in North Korea is. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall if there are any well-known North Korean athletes in swimming. North Korea does participate in international sports events, but their athletes aren't as widely recognized as those from other countries like the US or China.

I remember that there's a swimmer named Kim Jong-hyok. Wait, no, that might be a name I'm mixing up. Let me check. Oh right, there's a swimmer named Kim Jong-hyok who competed in the Olympics. But I'm not sure about his achievements. Also, North Korea's sports are heavily state-controlled, so maybe their most famous athletes are those who have won medals in international competitions.

Wait, another name that comes to mind is Park Tae-hwan. But isn't he from South Korea? Yes, Park Tae-hwan is a South Korean swimmer who won Olympic medals. So that's not North Korea. Maybe I'm confusing the names here.

Alternatively, there's a swimmer named Ri Jong-sik. I think he competed in the 2016 Olympics. But I'm not sure about his fame. North Korea's media might promote their athletes, but internationally, they might not be as famous. 

Wait, maybe there's no swimmer from North Korea who is particularly famous on a global scale. The country might not have produced any Olympic medalists in swimming. So perhaps the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized swimmer, but if I have to name one, maybe it's someone like Kim Il-hong? No, I don't think that's correct.

I think I need to verify if there are any North Korean swimmers with notable achievements. Checking my memory, I recall that in the 2012 London Olympics, there was a swimmer named Kim Jong-hyok, but he didn't win any medals. Maybe he's considered the most famous because he was the first North Korean swimmer to compete in the Olympics? But I'm not certain. Alternatively, there might not be any famous swimmers, and the answer could be that there isn't one, but the user is expecting a name. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there is no widely known swimmer, but if I have to provide a name, perhaps it's a state-sponsored athlete, but I can't recall the exact name. Given the lack of information, maybe the safest",1,,,,,

New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in North Korea? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in North Korea. Let me start by recalling what I know about the North Korean education system. I remember that their curriculum is heavily influenced by the government, with a strong emphasis on ideology, military, and science.

First, I should check the typical structure of middle school education there. Middle school in North Korea is usually for students around 12 to 15 years old, corresponding to grades 7 to 9. The curriculum probably includes core subjects like mathematics, science, and language. But given the political context, there might be additional subjects focused on the regime's ideology, such as Juche philosophy, the leadership of the Kim family, and patriotism.

I might also consider subjects like history, which would likely be centered on North Korean history and the DPRK's perspective. Physical education and military training are probably part of the curriculum as well, given the emphasis on the military. There might be technical or vocational subjects, especially in the later grades, preparing students for specific roles in society.

However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. I've heard that the number of subjects can vary, but I need to find a reliable source or estimate. If I think about other countries, middle school might have around 10-15 subjects, but North Korea's might be different. For example, they might have mandatory subjects like:

1. Korean Language
2. Mathematics
3. Science (maybe split into physics, chemistry, biology)
4. History (North Korean history)
5. Geography
6. Ideological Education (Juche, Kim Il-sung, etc.)
7. Physical Education
8. Music and Art
9. Labor Education
10. Military Training
11. Technical Education (like engineering or agriculture)
12. Foreign Languages (maybe Russian or Chinese, but possibly limited)

Wait, but some subjects might be combined. For instance, science could be a single subject covering multiple areas. Also, ideological education might be a separate subject. If I count the above list, that's 12 subjects. However, I'm not certain if all these are taught in middle school or if some are introduced later. Another source I recall mentioned that North Korean middle schools have around 12 subjects, including the ideological ones. I think the answer is 12, but I need to confirm. Since I can't look it up, I'll go with the best of my knowledge and the structure",1,,,,1,1.0
Th-en-03,What is the most popular professional sports league in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular professional sports league in North Korea. Let me think. First, I know that North Korea is a country with a centralized government, and their sports are often state-controlled. They have a strong presence in sports like football (soccer), but I'm not sure if there's a professional league.

Wait, North Korea's sports teams, like their football team, are well-known internationally, but does that mean there's a professional league? I think in many countries, especially those with less developed economies, professional leagues might not exist or might be underdeveloped. North Korea's economy is quite isolated, so maybe their sports are more amateur or state-run rather than professional.

I should check if there are any official sports leagues. The Korean People's Army has sports teams, and there's the Korean People's Sports Committee. But are these considered professional leagues? Probably not. Professional leagues usually involve paid players, sponsorships, and organized leagues with teams competing regularly. In North Korea, sports are more about national pride and military aspects, so maybe they don't have a formal professional league structure.

Also, considering the political context, the government might prioritize sports as a way to showcase their strength and ideology rather than for commercial purposes. So, the most popular sports might be state-sponsored events or international competitions, not domestic professional leagues.

Therefore, the answer is likely that there is no professional sports league in North Korea. The country's sports are state-controlled and focused on international competitions rather than professional leagues. So the answer would be that there isn't a professional league, but the user asked for the most popular one. Alternatively, maybe the Korean People's Army sports teams are the closest, but they are not a league.

Wait, but the question specifically says ""professional sports league."" If there's no such thing, then the answer would be that there is none. However, I need to confirm if there's any existing league. A quick check in my memory: North Korea's football is part of FIFA, but their domestic league might be called something like the DPR Korea Premier League. But I'm not sure if that's considered professional. Also, I think the DPR Korea Premier League exists, but it's not well-known and might not be professional in the traditional sense. However, since the user is asking for the most popular, maybe that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there are no professional sports leagues, and the most popular sports are state-run. But I need to",1,,,,0,0
New-ko-03,What is the most popular children's song in North Korea that families sing together?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular children's song in North Korea is that families sing together. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean culture and music.

First, North Korea has a unique cultural environment, heavily influenced by the government's propaganda and ideology. Music there often promotes patriotism, loyalty to the leadership, and socialist values. Children's songs are likely to be part of this, aimed at instilling these values from a young age.

I remember that the ""Arirang"" is a traditional Korean folk song, but I'm not sure if it's specifically a children's song in North Korea. However, the North Korean government might have adapted or promoted certain songs for children. Another possibility is songs related to the Workers' Party or the leaders, like Kim Il-sung or Kim Jong-un. Maybe there's a song that's part of their education system or public events.

I should check if there are any well-known children's songs in North Korea. I recall that ""The Song of the Young Pioneers"" might be a possibility, as the Young Pioneers are a youth organization in North Korea. Alternatively, there's a song called ""The Flower of the Juche Idea,"" which is associated with the Juche ideology, but I'm not certain if that's a children's song.

Another angle: sometimes, the government creates specific songs for propaganda purposes. For example, ""The Song of the Red Star"" might be a children's song, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""We Are the Hope of the Nation"" or something similar. However, without specific knowledge, it's hard to say.

Wait, I think I've heard that ""The Song of the Young Pioneers"" is a significant song in North Korea. It's used in schools and by the Young Pioneers organization, which is for children. This might be the one that families sing together, especially during events or gatherings. However, I'm not 100% certain. Another possibility is ""The Song of the Korean People's Army,"" but that might be more for military personnel.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a song that's part of their national curriculum. Since I can't look it up, I have to rely on existing knowledge. The most likely answer, based on what I remember, is ""The Song of the Young Pioneers"" or ""The Flower of the Juche Idea."" But I need to be careful here.

New-en-69,Which writers are commonly studied in literature class in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which writers are commonly studied in literature classes in North Korea. Let me think about this. I know that North Korea's education system emphasizes certain ideological aspects, so the literature they study is probably aligned with their political values.

First, I should recall if there are any well-known North Korean authors who are part of the curriculum. Kim Il-sung, the founder, might be a key figure. His works are likely included because they promote Juche ideology. Then there's his son, Kim Jong-il, who might have written or contributed to literature as well. Kim Jong-un is the current leader, but I'm not sure if he's studied as a writer or more as a political figure.

Other authors might include those who are part of the Korean People's Army or have written about the revolution. For example, Paek Nam-sun is a notable North Korean writer known for works like ""The Song of the Phoenix,"" which is about the Korean War. His works are probably part of the curriculum. Also, there might be other writers from the early 20th century who were involved in the anti-colonial movement, like Choe Nam-seon or Yi Hyo-jun, but I need to verify if they're still studied today.

Wait, but the question is about current literature classes. So maybe the focus is more on contemporary North Korean authors who promote the regime's ideology. The ""Three Revolutions"" literature might be part of it, which includes works that glorify the leadership and the revolution. Also, there's the ""Juche Literature"" movement, which emphasizes self-reliance and national pride.

I should check if there are any specific names that are commonly mentioned in this context. Kim Il-sung's ""The Song of the General"" or his other writings are likely included. Then, Paek Nam-sun's works as mentioned. Also, maybe Kim Chaek, who wrote about the Korean War. There's also the possibility of including works by South Korean authors, but I think North Korea might focus more on their own writers rather than South Korean ones, especially those who are critical of the regime.

Another angle: the North Korean education system teaches literature that supports the state's narrative, so the authors would be those who are part of the official literary canon. This would include writers who have been recognized by the Workers' Party of Korea. So, the answer is likely to include Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, Paek Nam-sun, and",1,,,,0,0

New-ha-08,What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in North Korea?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about a food that children in North Korea typically dislike but the elderly enjoy. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall common foods in North Korea. Their diet is influenced by the country's resources and policies. Rice is a staple, but they also have dishes like kimchi, kimchi stew, and various types of stews. However, there are some dishes that are more common in certain age groups.

I remember that there's a dish called ""naengmyeon"" which is a cold noodle soup, popular in the summer. But I'm not sure if that's the one. Wait, maybe it's something else. Another possibility is ""sikhye,"" a sweet rice drink. But I think that's more of a general favorite.

Wait, there's a traditional dish called ""dolsot bibimbap,"" but that's more of a mixed rice dish. Hmm. Maybe it's about the texture or the ingredients. Children might dislike something that's too spicy or has a certain texture. 

Oh, I think I've heard that ""kimchi"" is a common answer to this kind of question. But wait, kimchi is usually liked by many, but maybe the elderly prefer the more traditional, fermented version, while children might find it too sour or spicy. However, I'm not entirely certain if that's the case in North Korea specifically.

Alternatively, there's a dish called ""pajeon"" (a type of pancake), but I'm not sure about its popularity among different age groups. Another angle: in some countries, certain preserved or fermented foods are more favored by the elderly. North Korea has limited access to some ingredients, so maybe they have a specific dish that's more common among the elderly.

Wait, I think the answer they're looking for is ""kimchi."" But I need to verify. Maybe it's ""kimchi"" because children might find it too strong, while the elderly enjoy the flavor. However, I should check if there's a more specific answer. Alternatively, there's a dish called ""guk"" (soup) that's more consumed by the elderly, but I'm not sure.

I think the most commonly cited answer for such questions is kimchi, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps ""kimchi stew"" (kimchi jjigae) is the answer. However, I'm not 100% certain. Given the constraints, I'll go with kimchi as the answer",1,,,,0,0

Ni-en-31,What do people in North Korea traditionally eat on Christmas Day?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what people in North Korea traditionally eat on Christmas Day. Let me start by recalling what I know about North Korean culture and holidays. Christmas isn't a traditional holiday in North Korea, as it's a Christian holiday and the country is officially atheist, with the government promoting Juche ideology. However, there might be some Western influences or maybe the government might have their own way of handling it.

Wait, but I remember hearing that in North Korea, they sometimes have their own version of Christmas, but it's not the same as in Western countries. Maybe they have a different name for it? Also, considering their cuisine, their traditional foods are things like kimchi, rice, and various meats. But would they have a special meal on Christmas?

I should check if there are any sources mentioning North Korean Christmas traditions. However, since I can't access external information, I have to rely on existing knowledge. There's a possibility that they might not celebrate Christmas at all, but if they do, maybe they have a meal similar to their regular festive foods. Alternatively, maybe they have a special dish, but I'm not sure. I think some reports suggest that North Korea might have a Christmas meal, possibly including dishes like kimchi, rice, and maybe some meat, but it's not clear if it's a traditional practice or something more recent.

Wait, but I also recall that in some cases, the North Korean government might hold events on Christmas, but the people's actual traditions might not be well-documented. Since the user is asking for traditional foods, and if there's no established tradition, the answer might be that they don't have a traditional Christmas meal. However, I need to be accurate here. Another angle: maybe they have a meal similar to their New Year's Eve, which is a significant holiday. But that's not Christmas.

Alternatively, considering that Christmas is a Western holiday, and North Korea's culture is quite isolated, it's possible that they don't have traditional foods associated with Christmas. However, if they do celebrate, perhaps they might have a meal that's similar to a Western Christmas dinner, but with local ingredients. But that's speculative. 

Given the lack of clear information, the safest answer is that North Korea does not have a traditional Christmas meal as it is not a recognized holiday there. However, if the user is expecting an answer based on the possibility that they might have some form of celebration, but without specific traditional dishes, the answer would be that there",1,,,,,
