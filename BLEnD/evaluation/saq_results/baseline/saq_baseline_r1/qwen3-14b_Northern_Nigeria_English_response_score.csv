Ji-ko-29,Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Northern Nigeria's society?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Northern Nigeria's society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Northern Nigerian culture. 

Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so Islamic traditions play a significant role. In many Muslim cultures, certain ages are considered more significant. For example, the 13th, 15th, 17th, and 18th birthdays might be important, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, there's a tradition called ""Sallah"" or ""Eid"" celebrations, but those are religious festivals, not individual birthdays. Maybe there's a specific age that's culturally significant. 

I remember that in some parts of West Africa, the 40th birthday is a big deal, known as ""Forty"" or ""Kwame"" in some cultures. However, that might be more common in Ghana. 

Alternatively, in Islamic culture, the 13th birthday is sometimes celebrated as the age when a child is considered responsible or enters adolescence. But I'm not certain about Northern Nigeria specifically. 

Wait, there's also the concept of ""Jubilee"" or milestone birthdays, but I need to focus on Northern Nigeria. Maybe the 13th birthday is significant because it's when a child is considered to be entering a new stage of life, but I'm not sure if it's the most grandly celebrated. 

Alternatively, maybe the 15th birthday, as it's a common age for coming-of-age ceremonies in some cultures. However, in many parts of Nigeria, the 1st birthday (also known as ""Igba Nkwu"" in Igbo culture) is celebrated with a big party, but that's more in the south. 

Wait, the question specifies Northern Nigeria. In the north, where Hausa-Fulani culture is dominant, I'm not sure about specific age celebrations. However, I think that in some cases, the 13th birthday is considered important. 

Alternatively, maybe the 18th birthday is more significant as it's the age of adulthood. But I need to verify. 

Wait, I think I've heard that in some parts of Northern Nigeria, the 13th birthday is celebrated with a big ceremony called ""Tirikin"" or something similar. However, I'm not entirely certain. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the 1st birthday, but that's more common in the south.",1,,,,1,1.0
New-pe-20,What sport is popular to play on the beach in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about a sport popular on the beach in Northern Nigeria. First, I need to recall what sports are commonly associated with beaches. The first thing that comes to mind is volleyball, especially beach volleyball. But wait, is that actually popular in Northern Nigeria?

Wait, Northern Nigeria is mostly inland, right? It's not a coastal area. The coast is more in the south, like Lagos, Port Harcourt, etc. So maybe the question is a bit confusing. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe there are beaches in the north, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, could it be something else? Maybe soccer is popular everywhere in Nigeria, but that's not specifically a beach sport. Or maybe swimming? But not sure if that's a popular sport on the beach there.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in geography. Northern Nigeria isn't known for beaches. However, maybe there's a local sport played on sandy areas. Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question where the answer is that there are no beaches, so no sport is played there. But that seems too harsh.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific beach in the north, but I can't think of any. Maybe the answer is that there's no popular beach sport in Northern Nigeria because it's not a coastal region. But the question assumes there is one.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like wrestling or other traditional sports, but those aren't beach-specific. Hmm. I need to verify. Maybe looking up common beach sports in Nigeria. From what I know, beach volleyball is played in coastal areas like Lagos. But Northern Nigeria isn't coastal. So perhaps the answer is that there's no popular beach sport there, but the question expects an answer. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken and the answer is beach volleyball regardless, but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, maybe there's a local sport. Wait, maybe it's not a standard sport. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no beach sport popular there because there are no beaches. But the question is phrased as if there is one. Maybe the answer is that soccer is played on beaches, but that's not typical. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is that there's no popular beach sport in Northern Nigeria, but since the question asks for one, perhaps the user intended a different region.

Jod-ch-60,What is the duration (in hours) of a typical workday in Northern Nigeria? (Provide Arabic numerals (0~24) only.),"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the typical workday duration in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about work hours in Nigeria. I think in many African countries, the standard workday is around 8 hours, similar to many Western countries. But I should check if there are any differences based on region or industry.

Northern Nigeria might have some variations. Maybe due to cultural factors or economic activities. For example, in some places, especially in more traditional sectors, work hours might be adjusted based on the time of year or religious practices. But I'm not sure about that. Also, government offices and private sectors might have different schedules.

I remember that in Nigeria, the official workweek is usually 5 days, with Saturday off. But the actual hours per day could vary. In urban areas, it's likely to be the standard 8 hours, maybe from 8 AM to 5 PM or similar. However, in rural areas or certain industries, it might be longer or shorter. But the question is about Northern Nigeria specifically. 

I should also consider if there are any labor laws that dictate this. Nigeria has labor laws that set the standard working hours. According to the Nigerian Labour Act, the maximum hours of work per day is 8 hours, and the minimum is 6 hours. But the typical duration might be 8 hours. However, some sources might say that in practice, especially in some regions, people might work more than 8 hours due to various factors.

Wait, but the user is asking for a typical workday. So maybe the answer is 8 hours. However, I should verify if there's a specific standard for Northern Nigeria. I don't have specific data on Northern Nigeria's work hours differing from other regions. It's possible that the standard is the same across the country, but maybe in some sectors, like agriculture, work hours can be longer. However, the question is about a typical workday, which is likely referring to the standard in formal sectors.

Another angle: in some Muslim-majority regions, prayer times might affect work hours. For example, work might be scheduled around prayer times, but the total hours might still be around 8. I think in many places, even with religious considerations, the total hours are kept to 8. 

Considering all that, the safest answer is 8 hours. Unless there's a specific reason to think otherwise, but I don't have information indicating a different standard in Northern Nigeria. So I'll go with",1,,,,1,1.0

Al-en-19,What is a popular second language for high school students in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a popular second language for high school students in Northern Nigeria. First, I need to recall the linguistic landscape of Northern Nigeria.

Northern Nigeria is predominantly inhabited by Hausa-Fulani people, so Hausa is a major local language there. However, the question is about a second language, which usually refers to languages other than the native tongue. In Nigerian schools, especially in the north, English is the official language of instruction. But the question specifies a ""second language,"" which might mean a language other than the primary native language and English.

Wait, but in many cases, English is the primary second language taught in schools across Nigeria. However, the question might be looking for a local language that's commonly learned as a second language in that region. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to French, but French is more common in the south due to colonial history. Wait, no, Nigeria was a British colony, so English is the main official language. 

But in Northern Nigeria, there's also the use of Arabic, especially for religious education. However, Arabic is more of a religious language rather than a general second language. But maybe in some schools, especially Islamic schools, Arabic is taught. However, the question is about high school students in general. 

Another angle: the Federal Ministry of Education in Nigeria mandates that English is the medium of instruction, but in some regions, local languages are also used. However, the second language here might be English. But the user is asking for a language other than the first language (which would be Hausa or another local language). So English would be the second language. But maybe the answer they are looking for is English. However, the user might be expecting a local language as a second language. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the primary language is Hausa, then English would be the second language. So perhaps the answer is English. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a common misconception here. Let me check. In Northern Nigeria, English is the primary language used in education, government, and business. So even though Hausa is spoken at home, English is the second language they learn in school. So the answer would be English. However, the question says ""a popular second language,"" so maybe there's another one. But I can't think of another major one. Maybe French? But that's not common. Or maybe another local language, but that would depend on the specific",1,,,,1,1.0
Ne-ar-09,What do people from Northern Nigeria eat in Eid ul Fitr?,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what people in Northern Nigeria eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me start by recalling what I know about Eid ul Fitr. It's a Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. So, during this time, people celebrate with special foods, family gatherings, and giving to the poor.

Now, focusing on Northern Nigeria. I know that the cuisine there is different from the south. The north is more traditional, with a lot of Fulani and Hausa influences. They might have dishes that are more meat-based and use ingredients like millet, sorghum, and various spices.

I remember that in many parts of Nigeria, especially the north, people eat special dishes during Eid. One common dish is ""Suya,"" which is grilled meat, usually beef or chicken, skewered and seasoned with spices. But wait, is that specific to Eid? Or is it a general street food?

Another thing is ""Tuwo Shinko,"" which is a type of porridge made from cassava flour. But I think that's more common in the south. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. In the north, they might have ""Koko"" which is a breakfast dish made from groundnuts and milk, but I'm not sure if that's for Eid specifically.

Then there's ""Fufu"" and ""Pounded Yam,"" but those are more common in the south. The north might have their own version of ""Tuwo,"" which is a type of porridge. Also, ""Moin Moin"" is a steamed bean pudding, but again, I think that's more of a Yoruba dish from the west.

Wait, maybe ""Kuli Kuli"" is something they eat. That's a spicy groundnut soup. Or ""Makokor,"" which is a sweet made from millet or sorghum. Also, ""Banga"" is a soup made from palm fruit, but I think that's more in the south. 

Another possibility is ""Bianka,"" which is a type of porridge made from maize. Or ""Banga Soup"" with meat. But I'm not certain. Also, during Eid, there's a tradition of giving ""Eidi"" to children, but that's not food. 

I should also consider the fact that during Eid, people might prepare special dishes like ""Suya,"" ""Koko,"" ""Tuwo Shinko",1,,,,1,0.5
New-su-24,What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in that region. Northern Nigeria is mostly inhabited by Muslim populations, so maybe there are sports that are popular there.

First, I know that football (soccer) is a very popular sport in Nigeria overall. It's common in both urban and rural areas. But does it involve parents and children playing together? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the most common one for family interactions.

Then there's traditional games. I remember that some African countries have traditional games that families play. For example, games like ""Kicking a ball with feet"" or ""Throwing sticks"" might be common. But I'm not certain about the specific names or if they are played in Northern Nigeria specifically.

Another possibility is games that don't require much equipment. Maybe something like ""Catch"" or ""Tag,"" which are universal. But I need to check if those are specifically mentioned in the context of Northern Nigeria.

Also, considering the cultural aspect, maybe there are sports or games that are part of festivals or community events. But the question is about daily or common activities between parents and children.

Wait, I think I've heard of a game called ""Kicking a ball with the feet"" which might be similar to football but more informal. Alternatively, maybe ""Gully football"" which is a street version of football. But again, I'm not sure if that's played by families together.

Alternatively, maybe there are traditional games like ""Igbo"" or ""Yoruba"" games, but those are more from other regions. Since the question is about Northern Nigeria, which is more Hausa, Fulani, etc., maybe there's a specific game associated with them.

Another angle: looking at the availability of sports equipment. In areas where resources are limited, sports that require minimal equipment are more common. So games like ""Stick fighting"" or ""Handball"" might be played. But I'm not sure about the exact names.

Alternatively, maybe ""Kicking a ball with feet"" is the main one. I think I've read that in some parts of Nigeria, including the north, people play a game similar to football but with a ball made from rags or other materials. This could be a common family activity.

But I need to confirm if there's a specific name for that game. If not, maybe just listing football as the primary answer. However, I should",1,,,,0,0
Ji-ko-42,What are the required subjects in Northern Nigeria's university entrance exam?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the required subjects for university entrance exams in Northern Nigeria. Let me think.

First, I need to recall the structure of the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) in Nigeria. The UTME is conducted by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). The core subjects are English Language, which is mandatory for all candidates. Then, depending on the course of study, there are other subjects. For example, science students might take Physics, Chemistry, and Biology or Mathematics. Arts students might take Literature, History, and Government. But the question is about Northern Nigeria specifically. Wait, does Northern Nigeria have any different requirements compared to other regions? I think the UTME is standardized across Nigeria, so the required subjects would be the same nationwide. However, maybe the user is confused because some states or universities might have additional requirements, but the main JAMB exam is the same. So the answer would be the standard UTME subjects. But I need to confirm if there's any regional variation. From what I know, the JAMB syllabus and required subjects are uniform across the country. Therefore, the required subjects are English Language and three other subjects based on the chosen course. However, the user might be referring to specific universities in the North, but unless they have special requirements, the answer remains the same. So the answer should list English Language and the other three subjects relevant to the course. But the user wants a list in JSON format without examples. Wait, the user's instruction says to provide one single answer as a list, but the example given in the JSON has ""answer here"" as a single string. Wait, the user says ""provide one single answer as a list form at the end in a JSON format"". So the answer should be a list of subjects. But the actual required subjects depend on the course. However, the question is phrased as ""required subjects"" in general. Maybe the core subjects are English Language and then three others based on the course. But the user might be expecting the standard core subjects. However, the JAMB exam requires four subjects: English and three others. So the answer would be that English Language is required, and then three other subjects depending on the course. But the user might be looking for the standard set, but since it's Northern Nigeria, perhaps there's a common set. Wait, no. The UTME is the same across Nigeria. So the answer is that the required subjects are English Language and",1,,,,1,1.0

Th-en-53,What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the most popular extracurricular social event in schools in Northern Nigeria. First, I need to recall what extracurricular activities are common there. Northern Nigeria has a strong cultural and religious influence, so events might be shaped by that.

I know that in many parts of Nigeria, cultural festivals and competitions are common. For example, things like cultural nights, talent shows, or sports events. But since the question specifies Northern Nigeria, I should think about specific traditions there. Maybe events related to Islamic culture, like Quranic recitation competitions or Eid celebrations? Or perhaps school-based events like inter-house competitions, debates, or drama festivals.

Wait, but the question is about social events. Social events might include things like dances, music festivals, or community gatherings. However, in a school setting, it could be more structured. I remember that in some Nigerian schools, especially in the North, there are events like ""cultural festivals"" where students showcase traditional dances, music, and attire. These events are often held during school terms and are popular among students.

Another possibility is sports events, but the question specifies social events, so maybe more about interaction and community rather than physical activities. Also, there might be inter-school competitions, but those might be more academic or sports-related.

Alternatively, considering the religious aspect, there could be events like charity drives or community service projects, but those might be more service-oriented than social. 

Wait, I should verify if there's a commonly known event. Maybe ""cultural festivals"" or ""inter-house competitions"" are the most popular. But I need to be specific. Another angle: in Northern Nigeria, schools might have events that celebrate local traditions, such as Hausa-Fulani cultural events, which could include dance, music, and storytelling. These could be part of the extracurricular activities.

Alternatively, think about the ""Student Day"" or ""School Anniversary"" events where various activities are held. But I need to find the most popular one. 

From what I've read before, cultural festivals are often highlighted as significant in Nigerian schools, especially in the North, as they promote cultural heritage and provide a social platform for students. So, I think the answer is cultural festivals or similar events. I need to make sure there isn't a more specific term. Maybe ""cultural day"" or ""cultural show."" But the user wants the answer in a list, so the most accurate term would be """,1,,,,,
Ca-sp-06,Which is the most important meal of the day to people from Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which meal is the most important for people from Northern Nigeria. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many parts of Nigeria, especially the Northern regions, the main meals are often based around staples like rice, millet, sorghum, or yam. But which one is considered the most important?

In the North, there's a lot of influence from the Hausa, Fulani, and other ethnic groups. I remember that breakfast might be something like ""koko"" (a porridge made from millet or sorghum) with eggs, but I'm not sure if that's the most important meal.

Then there's the midday meal, which is usually the main one. Lunch might be more substantial, with dishes like ""tuwo"" (a type of porridge made from cassava or maize), or ""miyan kuka"" (a millet porridge). But wait, in some areas, the main meal is around sunset, which is when they have ""suya"" or other meat dishes. However, that might be more of a snack or evening meal.

Wait, maybe the main meal is the one that's eaten in the evening, known as ""dinner."" But I think in many cultures, the main meal is the one that's the largest and most communal. For example, in some regions, the evening meal is the main one, but in others, it's lunch.

Alternatively, I've heard that in Northern Nigeria, the most important meal is often the one that includes ""tuwo"" or ""koko,"" but I need to confirm. Also, considering the time of day, maybe breakfast is the most important? Or perhaps the main meal is the one that's consumed with family and is the largest in terms of quantity and variety.

Wait, there's a term called ""main meal"" which could be either lunch or dinner. But I think in the North, the main meal is often the one that's eaten in the evening, which might be called ""dinner."" However, I should check if there's a specific meal that's considered the most important. Maybe ""tuwo"" is the main dish, but the meal itself would be the time when it's eaten.

Alternatively, the most important meal might be the one that's the first meal of the day, like breakfast, but I think in many cultures, the main meal is the one that's the largest. However, I need to be accurate here.",1,,,,1,1.0

Th-en-44,What is Northern Nigeria's most popular food for family meals on weekends?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most popular food in Northern Nigeria for family meals on weekends. Let me think about this. Northern Nigeria has a lot of traditional dishes, but which one is most commonly associated with family gatherings?

First, I know that jollof rice is popular across Nigeria, but maybe that's more of a national dish. Then there's suya, which is grilled meat, but is that typically a weekend meal? Maybe not the main dish. 

Then there's the famous ""Pounded Yam and Egusi Soup."" Wait, but that's more from the south. Wait, no, Northern Nigeria has different staples. They eat more of the ""tuwo"" or ""tuwo shinkafa,"" which is a type of porridge made from sorghum or millet. But maybe that's not the main dish.

Wait, another thought: ""Koko"" is a breakfast dish made from yam flour, but that's more of a daily meal. Then there's ""Banga Soup,"" which is made from palm fruit, but that's from the south again. 

Wait, maybe ""Suya"" is a popular street food, but again, not sure about weekend family meals. 

Wait, I think the most common dish in Northern Nigeria is ""Pounded Yam and Egusi Soup,"" but I'm not sure if that's in the North. Wait, no, in the North, they might have ""Tuwo with Egusi Soup"" or ""Tuwo with Groundnut Soup."" But I'm getting confused between the regions. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Maafe,"" which is a peanut stew, is popular in the North. Or ""Miyan Kuka,"" which is a type of porridge. 

Wait, I need to be careful. Let me recall. Northern Nigerian cuisine includes dishes like ""Tuwo"" (a porridge made from sorghum or millet), ""Fura"" (a type of porridge), and ""Maafe"" (peanut stew). Also, ""Suya"" is popular, but that's more of a snack. 

But for family meals on weekends, maybe the most common is ""Tuwo with Egusi Soup"" or ""Tuwo with Groundnut Soup."" However, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe ""Pounded Yam and Egusi"" is more common in the South, while the North has different variations.

Th-en-45,What is the most popular weekday evening family activity in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the most popular weekday evening family activity in Northern Nigeria. First, I need to consider the cultural and social context of Northern Nigeria. The region is predominantly Muslim, so religious practices might play a significant role.

Weekday evenings, so not weekends. In many Muslim communities, Friday is a day of prayer, but other weekdays might have different activities. However, the question specifies a weekday evening, so maybe not Friday. But I should check if there's a specific activity that's common.

I know that in many parts of Nigeria, especially in the North, family gatherings, storytelling, or religious activities like attending mosque or reading the Quran might be common. But is there a specific activity that's most popular?

Another angle: maybe communal activities. For example, people might gather for meals, or watch TV together. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular. Alternatively, maybe sports or games, but that might be more common in other regions.

Wait, I remember that in some Northern Nigerian communities, the evening is a time for family prayers, especially after the daily prayers. But since the question is about a family activity, maybe it's more about shared activities. Another possibility is that families might engage in traditional games or storytelling, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe watching religious programs or attending study circles. However, I need to be careful not to assume. Since I might not have the exact data, but based on cultural practices, the most common family activity in the evenings could be gathering for prayers or religious discussions. However, if it's a weekday, maybe it's more about family meals or time spent together, but that's more general.

Wait, I should think about the most common activities. In many parts of Nigeria, especially in the North, after work, families might come together for dinner and then spend time together. But is that considered a specific activity? Or perhaps they engage in activities like listening to the Quran, attending a local religious meeting, or participating in community events.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the most popular activity is attending evening prayers at the mosque. But I'm not sure if that's the case for all families. Another thought: in some cultures, evenings are for family storytelling or teaching children, but again, not sure.

I need to make an educated guess here. Considering the religious aspect and the family aspect, perhaps the most popular activity is family prayer or Quranic recitation. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's",1,,,,0,0

Ji-ko-34,How do elementary school students in Northern Nigeria go to school?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about how elementary school students in Northern Nigeria go to school. First, I need to recall what I know about education systems in Nigeria, especially in the northern regions.

I remember that Nigeria has a federal system, so education might be managed at the state level. In Northern Nigeria, there might be a mix of public and private schools. Public schools are likely government-funded, while private schools could be religious or secular. 

Transportation is another factor. In rural areas, students might walk to school, especially if there's no public transport. In urban areas, maybe they use buses or motorbikes. Also, cultural factors: some schools might be co-ed, others single-sex. Uniforms are common in many schools there.

Another point is the curriculum. Northern Nigeria might have schools that follow the national curriculum but with some local adaptations. Also, there might be a focus on Islamic education in some areas, especially in states with significant Muslim populations. 

Wait, but the question is about how they go to school, not the curriculum. So transportation methods, school types (public, private, religious), and maybe the structure of the school day. Also, the language of instruction could be English, Hausa, or another local language, depending on the school.

I should make sure not to include things like curriculum details unless they directly relate to how they attend school. So the main points would be the types of schools they attend and the transportation methods. Maybe also mention if there are any specific challenges, like distance or infrastructure, but the question is about the method of attending, not the challenges.

So compiling this, the answer would list the types of schools (public, private, religious), transportation methods (walking, buses, motorbikes), and possibly the use of uniforms and language of instruction. But the user asked for a single answer in a list. Let me check the example again. The user provided an example where the answer is a list of one item, but maybe they want multiple points in the list. Wait, the user says ""provide one single answer as a list form"" but the example shows a list with one item. Wait, the example given by the user is:

Jod-ch-01,What eating utensils do people commonly used in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what eating utensils are commonly used in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about Nigerian culture, especially in the north. I remember that in many parts of Africa, people use their hands to eat, especially with certain types of food. But I should check if that's the case in Northern Nigeria specifically.

Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so maybe their eating habits are influenced by Islamic traditions. In some Islamic cultures, using hands is common, especially for certain dishes. However, there might be variations based on the region or the type of meal. For example, when eating with hands, people might use their right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean in some cultures.

But wait, there are also utensils used. Maybe spoons or plates? I think in some areas, people might use wooden spoons or ladles for soups and stews. Also, plates made of metal or ceramic could be common. However, I'm not sure if these are used as much as hands. Another thought: in some parts of Nigeria, especially in the south, people use a type of wooden spoon called a ""spoon"" or ""ekpe"" for eating porridge or other dishes. But does that apply to the north?

Wait, maybe the primary utensil is the hand. For example, when eating foods like fufu, which is a thick paste, people use their hands to tear off pieces and dip into soup. But in Northern Nigeria, maybe they have different staple foods. What's commonly eaten there? Maybe dishes like tuwo (a type of porridge), which could be eaten with a spoon or with hands. However, I'm not certain. Also, considering the use of communal dishes, people might eat directly from the dish using their hands, especially when sharing food.

Another angle: in some parts of Northern Nigeria, people might use a ""kuli"" or a type of wooden ladle. Alternatively, metal spoons could be used for certain dishes. But I need to verify if these are common. Also, considering the influence of neighboring countries, maybe similar utensils are used as in other West African countries.

Wait, but the question is about Northern Nigeria specifically. I should focus on that. I think the most common utensil is the hand, especially for eating staple foods like tuwo, which is a thick porridge. People might use their hands to scoop it up. However, for soups or stews, maybe a spoon",1,,,,0,0

Th-en-11,Who is the most popular sportperson in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking who the most popular sportsperson in Northern Nigeria is. Let me think about this.

First, I need to consider what sports are popular in Northern Nigeria. Football (soccer) is definitely a big one there, just like in the rest of the country. Then there's basketball, which has a strong following, especially with the NBA's influence. Also, traditional sports like wrestling or athletics might have local heroes.

Now, thinking about prominent athletes from Northern Nigeria. There's Nwankwo Kanu, but he's from Enugu, which is in the South-East. Then there's Victor Moses, who plays for the Nigerian national team. Wait, he's from Lagos, which is in the South-West. Maybe someone like John Mikel Obi? He's from Imo State, which is in the South-East again. Hmm, not Northern.

Wait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me think about basketball players. There's Chidiebere Okonkwo, but I'm not sure about his popularity. Or maybe someone from the NBA? Like the late Dikembe Mutombo, but he was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, though he played for the NBA. Not sure if he's considered a Northern Nigerian.

Another angle: maybe a local hero in a specific sport. For example, in boxing, there might be someone from the North. Or perhaps in athletics, someone like Eunice Chinyere, but I think she's from the South.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone more recent. Let me check if there are any current athletes from Northern Nigeria who are widely recognized. There's possibly someone like Ifeanyi Ubah, but he's from Abia State, which is in the South-East. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a single most popular sportsperson, but the question requires a specific name. However, without up-to-date information, it's hard to confirm. Since the user might be expecting a well-known name, but I can't recall a specific Northern Nigerian athlete who is universally recognized as the most popular. Maybe the answer is that there isn't a single individual, but the user wants a name. In that case, perhaps the best approach is to state that there isn't a universally recognized most popular sportsperson, but if forced to name one, it might be someone like Victor Moses, even though he's from Lagos. But that's in the South. Alternatively",1,,,,0,0

Na-ko-20,What sports event do people from Northern Nigeria passionately support the most in international competitions?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports event people from Northern Nigeria are most passionate about in international competitions. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Nigeria.

Nigeria has a strong presence in several sports, like football (soccer), athletics, basketball, and boxing. But the question specifically asks about Northern Nigeria. I remember that Northern Nigeria has a significant population, and there might be regional preferences. 

Football is huge in Nigeria overall, with the national team, the Super Eagles, being a major point of pride. But maybe the Northern states have their own teams or events they support more. However, the question is about international competitions, so events like the Africa Cup of Nations or the Olympics.

Wait, there's also the Nigerian Premier League, but that's domestic. International events would be things like the FIFA World Cup, African Championships, or Olympics. But the user wants the specific event that Northerners support the most. 

Another angle: some sports might be more popular in certain regions. For example, wrestling or boxing might have more following in the North. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Nigeria national football team is still the top choice, even regionally.

I should check if there's any data or common knowledge about regional sports preferences. From what I've heard, football is the most popular sport in Nigeria as a whole, and the Super Eagles' participation in the World Cup qualifiers or the Africa Cup of Nations would be major events. Even if it's nationwide, Northerners might still support it the most. 

I don't recall specific events unique to Northern Nigeria in international competitions. So the answer is likely the Nigerian national football team's events, like the FIFA World Cup or Africa Cup of Nations. But the answer needs to be a single event. Maybe the Africa Cup of Nations since it's a continental event and more relevant to African teams. Alternatively, the FIFA World Cup is a global event, but the Super Eagles' participation would be the key.

Wait, the question is about the sports event, not the team. So the event would be something like the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) or the FIFA World Cup. Since the Super Eagles are the national team, their participation in these events would be the sports events. But which one do Northerners support more? Given that AFCON is more frequently participated in by Nigeria, maybe that's the answer. However, the World Cup is a bigger global event, but Nigeria hasn't qualified recently.

New-gr-06,What is the most popular food in Northern Nigeria among young people?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most popular food in Northern Nigeria among young people. Let me think.

First, I know that Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so their cuisine is influenced by West African and Middle Eastern flavors. Common dishes there include things like Tuwo Shinkafa, which is a type of porridge made from sorghum or millet. But is that popular among young people?

Wait, maybe there's something more modern or trendy. Young people might be influenced by global trends or have preferences for convenience. However, traditional foods are still significant. Another dish is Suya, which is grilled meat skewers. That's popular across Nigeria, but more as a street food. 

Then there's Akara, which is a bean cake. It's common in the south, but maybe also eaten in the north. However, I'm not sure if it's the most popular among youth there. 

Wait, could it be something like Puff Puff? That's a fried dough snack, popular nationwide. But again, is it the most popular in the north specifically?

Alternatively, maybe a fast food item like fried rice or local variants of burgers? Or maybe the traditional dish like Koko (a porridge made from maize or millet) is still popular. 

Wait, I should check if there are any surveys or articles about this. But since I can't access current data, I have to rely on common knowledge. In many parts of Nigeria, especially the north, Tuwo Shinkafa is a staple. It's made from sorghum or millet and is eaten with various stews. However, younger generations might prefer more modern dishes, but traditional ones are still prevalent. 

Another thought: maybe the answer is Suya, as it's a popular street food and often consumed by younger people. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, could it be a specific type of soup or stew? 

Hmm, maybe the answer is Tuwo Shinkafa, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for a more specific answer. I think I need to go with Tuwo Shinkafa as the most popular traditional dish, even if there are other popular items. But I should make sure. Another possibility is that it's a combination of dishes, but the question asks for one answer. 

Wait, maybe I should consider that in Northern Nigeria, the primary staple is sorghum or millet, so Tuwo Shinkafa",1,,,,1,1.0

Th-en-37,"At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Northern Nigeria? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the typical age children become independent from their parents in Northern Nigeria. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about cultural practices in Northern Nigeria. The region is predominantly Muslim, and traditional family structures might influence this. In many parts of Africa, children often stay with their parents until they're married or can support themselves. But I'm not sure about the exact age.

I remember that in some cultures, especially in rural areas, children might get married young. Early marriage could be a factor here. However, the age of majority in Nigeria is 18, but that's legally. Socially, maybe it's different. Also, education plays a role. If children go to school, they might stay longer, but in areas with limited education, they might leave earlier.

Wait, there's also the aspect of gender. Girls might be expected to leave earlier if they get married, while boys might stay longer to work or study. But the question doesn't specify gender, so I need a general answer.

I should check if there are any studies or data on this. From what I've read before, in some parts of Northern Nigeria, children might become independent around 18-20, but this can vary widely based on economic factors, education, and cultural norms. However, early marriage practices might lead some girls to leave as early as 15-16. But the question is about becoming independent, which could include marriage or starting work.

But the user wants an Arabic numeral answer, probably an average or common age. However, I need to be cautious not to generalize. If there's no single answer, maybe the answer is that it varies, but the user wants a specific number. Maybe 18 is the age of majority, but socially, it's different. Alternatively, some sources might suggest 15-20 as a range, but the user wants a single number.

Wait, perhaps in some communities, children are considered independent once they get married, which could be as early as 15. But I'm not certain. Since the user requires a specific number, maybe the answer is 18, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can't confirm, maybe I should state that it varies, but the user wants a numerical answer. I need to make sure I don't provide incorrect information.

Alternatively, perhaps in Northern Nigeria, due to traditional practices, children might leave home around 15-",1,,,,1,1.0
Na-ko-39,What is typically given as a congratulatory gesture when attending a friend's wedding in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the typical congratulatory gesture given at a friend's wedding in Northern Nigeria. I need to recall or figure out what's common there.

First, I know that in many African cultures, gifts are given in the form of money or items. But specifically in Northern Nigeria, which is predominantly Muslim, maybe there's something specific. I remember that in some parts, people give cash, but maybe there's a traditional item. Wait, maybe it's a fabric? Like a kofia or a piece of cloth? Or maybe it's a gift of food or something else. Alternatively, could it be a symbolic item like a key or something representing the new home? Or perhaps it's a gift card or envelope with money. Wait, I think in some Nigerian cultures, especially in the north, they might give a ""gift"" in the form of a cash envelope, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific item like a traditional dress or a decorative item. But I need to be careful not to confuse with other regions. Let me think again. In Northern Nigeria, during weddings, especially in the Hausa-Fulani culture, it's common to give money as a gift. The money is usually given in an envelope, sometimes with a note. But is there a specific item that's more traditional? Oh, sometimes they might give a piece of cloth or a traditional headwrap, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe a gift for the couple's home, like kitchenware or something. Wait, but the question is about a congratulatory gesture, which could be either a gift or a symbolic item. Another thought: in some cultures, they give a gift that symbolizes prosperity, like a plant or a fruit. But I'm not sure. I think the most common answer would be cash given in an envelope, but I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific type of gift, like a ""gift"" in the form of a traditional item. However, I think the safest answer is that cash is given as a gift. But maybe there's a more traditional item. Wait, I've heard that in some parts, they give a ""groom's gift"" which could be money or other items. I think the answer is that they give money, so the answer would be ""cash in an envelope"" or ""monetary gift"". Alternatively, maybe it's a specific type of item like a kofia or a",1,,,,0,0

Na-ko-33,What symbolic food do people from Northern Nigeria eat on (Lunar) New Year?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the symbolic food eaten by people from Northern Nigeria during Lunar New Year. Hmm, first, I need to confirm if Northern Nigeria actually celebrates Lunar New Year. Wait, Lunar New Year is a Chinese tradition, right? It's based on the lunar calendar and is celebrated in many East Asian countries. But Northern Nigeria is in Africa, and their major festivals are more aligned with Islamic traditions, like Eid celebrations.

Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. The user might be mixing up different cultural events. Let me check. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so they might celebrate Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha, not Lunar New Year. However, there could be a possibility of cultural exchange or a local adaptation. But I don't recall any specific traditional food associated with Lunar New Year in Northern Nigeria. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different festival. For example, during the Yoruba New Yam Festival in Nigeria, they eat new yam. But that's not Lunar New Year. Or maybe the user is mistaken and meant another holiday. However, the question specifically mentions Lunar New Year. 

I should verify if there's any connection between Lunar New Year and Northern Nigerian culture. A quick check in my mind: no, Lunar New Year isn't observed in Nigeria. So perhaps the answer is that there isn't a symbolic food for Lunar New Year in Northern Nigeria because they don't celebrate it. But the user is asking for the food, implying there is one. Maybe the user made an error in the question. 

Alternatively, could there be a local dish that's eaten during a similar time? For example, during the Islamic New Year, which is based on the lunar calendar, but that's different. The Islamic New Year is celebrated on the first day of Muharram. However, in Northern Nigeria, the main festive foods during Eid are things like Suya (grilled meat), Biscuits, and various sweet dishes. But these are for Eid, not Lunar New Year. 

So, putting it all together: the question might be based on a misunderstanding. Northern Nigeria doesn't celebrate Lunar New Year, so there's no specific symbolic food for that occasion. Therefore, the answer would be that there isn't a traditional symbolic food for Lunar New Year in Northern Nigeria as they don't observe it. However, the user might be expecting an answer, so maybe there's a local dish that's eaten during a similar festival. But",1,,,,0,0
Ki-pe-34,What is the usual drink in the breakfast in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the usual drink in breakfast in Northern Nigeria. Let me think. I know that in many parts of Nigeria, especially the north, traditional drinks are common. They often have a lot of milk products. For example, I've heard of a drink called ""tuwo"" or maybe ""koko,"" but wait, koko is more of a porridge. Oh, right, ""dodo"" is a type of porridge made from maize or millet, but that's more of a food. Then there's ""milk"" itself, but maybe they have a specific type of milk drink. Wait, ""milk tea"" is popular in some regions. But is that Northern Nigeria?

Wait, I think in the north, they might have ""koko"" which is a porridge made from maize, but that's more of a food item. Alternatively, maybe ""suya"" is a food, not a drink. Hmm. Another possibility is ""groundnut drink"" or ""locust bean soup,"" but those are more savory. Wait, perhaps ""milk"" is the answer. Because in the north, they have a lot of dairy products, like milk from cows or goats. Maybe they drink plain milk with breakfast. Or perhaps a tea made with milk, like ""milk tea"" or ""chicory tea"" which is common in the north. I think ""chicory tea"" is a traditional drink there. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me verify. Chicory tea is made from the roots of the chicory plant, and it's commonly consumed in the north, sometimes with milk or sugar. So maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, ""koko"" is a drink made from maize flour, but I think that's more of a porridge. Wait, maybe the answer is ""milk"" or ""chicory tea."" I need to check which one is more common for breakfast. Since the question is about the usual drink, maybe it's milk. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, could it be ""milk tea""? I think the most accurate answer is that the usual drink is milk or chicory tea. But since the user wants a single answer in a list, maybe the primary one is milk. Or maybe the answer is ""milk tea."" Wait, I think in some places, they have a drink called ""milk tea"" made with tea leaves, milk, and sugar.",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ch-07,What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what food items people in Northern Nigeria typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Northern Nigerian cuisine and drinking habits.

First, Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so alcohol consumption isn't common in the general population due to religious reasons. However, there might be certain contexts where hard liquor is consumed, perhaps in private settings or among specific groups. But I'm not sure about the exact food pairings.

I know that traditional dishes in the North include things like tuwo (a type of porridge made from sorghum or millet), suya (grilled meat skewers), and various stews like groundnut stew or moin moin (steamed bean cake). However, these are usually paired with soft drinks or local beers like Star or Gulder, not necessarily hard liquor.

Wait, but the question is about hard liquor. Maybe in some cases, people might pair it with snacks. In many parts of Africa, hard liquor like gin or whiskey is sometimes paired with snacks like roasted plantains, groundnuts (peanuts), or even dried meat. But I need to verify if this is specific to Northern Nigeria.

Alternatively, maybe there are no traditional pairings because alcohol isn't commonly consumed. However, the question assumes that there are typical pairings. Perhaps in social gatherings or certain cultural events, people might have hard liquor with local snacks. But I'm not certain about the exact items.

I should consider that the answer might be that there are no traditional food pairings with hard liquor in Northern Nigeria due to cultural and religious factors. But the question is asking for food items, so maybe the answer is that they don't typically pair hard liquor with specific foods, but if they do, it might be simple snacks like roasted nuts or bread.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that people don't commonly consume hard liquor, so there's no typical pairing. But the question is phrased as if there is an answer. I need to make sure I'm not making assumptions. Maybe looking up common Nigerian drinking foods, but since I can't do that, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

In some regions, people might drink hard liquor with spicy foods to balance the heat, but I don't know if that's the case in the North. Another angle: in Nigeria, when people drink alcohol, they might have snacks like puff puff (fried dough balls), akara (fried bean cakes), or other street foods. But again, this might be",1,,,,,

Th-en-35,"Which one of the daily meals is commonly shared with family members in Northern Nigeria? (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner)","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which daily meal is commonly shared with family members in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about Nigerian culture, specifically the Northern part.

First, I know that in many African cultures, meals are often communal, especially during certain times of the day. In Northern Nigeria, the primary ethnic groups include the Hausa, Fulani, and others. Their dietary habits might differ from the Southern part, which is more into things like pounded yam and fish, while the North might have more staples like rice, beans, and various stews.

Now, thinking about meal times. In many places, breakfast is a lighter meal, maybe just a quick bite. Lunch and dinner are more substantial. But which one is the family meal? In some cultures, dinner is the main meal of the day when families gather. But I'm not sure about Northern Nigeria specifically.

I remember that in some parts of West Africa, the evening meal is when families come together. Also, considering religious practices, like in Islam which is prevalent in Northern Nigeria, fasting during Ramadan might influence meal times. However, the question is about a daily meal, not during Ramadan. 

Another angle: traditional dishes. For example, in the North, dishes like tuwo (a type of porridge), koko (a spicy soup), and various types of stews are common. These might be prepared in larger quantities, suggesting they are shared meals. But when are they eaten?

Also, considering work schedules. If people work during the day, maybe dinner is when they return home. But in some cases, lunch might be the main meal. However, I think in many African countries, the main meal is often in the evening, so dinner. But I need to confirm this for Northern Nigeria specifically.

Wait, I've heard that in some parts of Nigeria, the main meal is called ""supper"" or ""dinner"" and is eaten in the evening. Also, family gatherings for meals are more common in the evening. So perhaps dinner is the one shared with family members. Let me check if there's any specific information about Northern Nigeria. 

Alternatively, maybe lunch is the main meal. But I think in the North, since the climate is hotter, people might eat lighter meals during the day and have a more substantial meal in the evening. So dinner would be the time when the family comes together. 

I think the answer is dinner. But I need to be sure. Maybe looking for cultural practices.",1,,,,1,1.0

Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the most popular indoor sport in Northern Nigeria. Hmm. First, I need to recall what sports are common in Nigeria, especially in the northern regions.

I know that football (soccer) is very popular across Nigeria, but that's usually played outdoors. However, maybe there's an indoor variant? Or perhaps another sport that's more suited for indoor play. Let me think. In many parts of Africa, traditional sports or games are played. But Northern Nigeria has a different cultural context compared to the south. 

Wait, there's a sport called ""Ko-ko"" or ""Ko-Ko"" which is a traditional game from the Hausa people, mainly in Northern Nigeria. It's played with a ball and involves kicking, similar to football but with different rules. But is it considered an indoor sport? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe indoor games like table tennis or badminton are popular, but I don't think they are the most popular in that region.

Another angle: in areas where outdoor space is limited, indoor sports might be more common. However, in Northern Nigeria, there might be more emphasis on traditional sports. Alternatively, maybe basketball is played indoors, but I'm not certain if that's the most popular.

Wait, I should verify. Some sources mention that ""Ko-Ko"" is a traditional sport in the north, but it's usually played in open fields. Maybe the user is referring to a different sport. Alternatively, perhaps indoor games like chess or checkers, but those are not physical sports.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is football, but since the question specifies indoor, maybe there's an indoor version. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the most popular indoor sport is not a traditional one but something like table tennis or badminton, but I need to check if that's accurate.

Wait, I think I need to be careful here. If I'm not certain, maybe the answer is football, but the user specified indoor. Perhaps the answer is ""Ko-Ko"" even if it's played outdoors, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized indoor sport, but the user expects an answer.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""Indoor football"" or ""Futsal,"" which is a variant played indoors. But is that popular in Northern Nigeria? I'm not sure. However",1,,,,0,0
New-spme-05,What are the most popular sweets in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the most popular sweets in Northern Nigeria. First, I need to recall what I know about Nigerian cuisine, specifically the northern regions. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Hausa, Fulani, and other ethnic groups, so their traditional sweets would likely reflect that.

I remember that in many parts of West Africa, including Nigeria, there are traditional sweets made from ingredients like millet, sorghum, or wheat flour. One that comes to mind is ""Koko,"" which is a sweet porridge made from cornmeal and sugar, often served with milk. But wait, isn't that more of a breakfast item? Maybe it's not a sweet per se but a sweetened dish.

Another possibility is ""Bouillie,"" which is a porridge-like dish, but again, not sure if it's considered a sweet. Then there's ""Kuli Kuli,"" which is a peanut butter candy, but that might be more common in the south. Wait, I need to be careful here. Let me think again.

In the north, there's a sweet called ""Guruma,"" which is a type of sweet made from millet flour, sugar, and sometimes sesame seeds. It's often molded into shapes and sold in markets. Then there's ""Dandakar,"" which is a sweet made from wheat flour, sugar, and ghee, similar to a bar or brick. Another one could be ""Bissap,"" but that's a drink, not a sweet.

Wait, maybe ""Koko"" is indeed a sweet. Also, ""Togwa"" is a sweet made from cassava, but I think that's more from the south. Let me check my memory again. There's also ""Kuli Kuli"" made from groundnuts (peanuts), but again, not sure if it's regional. Another possibility is ""Millet Cake"" or ""Sorghum Cake,"" which are sometimes sweetened with sugar or honey.

I think the key ones are Guruma, Dandakar, and Koko. Maybe ""Koko"" is more of a porridge but sweetened. Also, there's ""Suya"" but that's a meat skewer, not a sweet. Another thought: ""Togwa"" is a sweet made from cassava and sugar, but I'm not certain about its northern popularity. Alternatively, ""Bouillie"" is a porridge, but not sweet.

New-in-01,Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the most popular coffee shop brand in Northern Nigeria. First, I need to consider the region's cultural and economic context. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, and there's a strong tradition of tea consumption, especially in social and religious settings. However, coffee culture has been growing, influenced by urbanization and exposure to global trends.

I should think about major coffee chains that have a presence there. Starbucks is a global brand, but I'm not sure if they have a significant footprint in Northern Nigeria. Then there's Starbucks' competitor, like Café Coffee Day, which has been expanding in various African markets. However, I'm not certain about their presence in the North.

Local brands might be more prevalent. Brands like Java House or local cafes that have adapted to the regional taste might be popular. Also, there's the possibility of informal coffee vendors or traditional setups that serve coffee, though they might not be branded as such.

Another angle is looking at social media trends or recent articles about coffee shops in the region. If there's a brand that's been featured in local media or has a strong following, that could be a clue. However, without current data, it's tricky. Additionally, the term ""most popular"" can be subjective, varying by city or town.

Wait, there's also the influence of international franchises like Starbucks, but they might be more concentrated in the South, where there's a higher concentration of expats and more cosmopolitan areas. In contrast, Northern Nigeria might have fewer international chains and more local or regional brands.

Alternatively, maybe a brand like The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf has a presence, but again, I'm not sure about their reach in the North. It's possible that the most popular coffee shop isn't a global chain but a local one that's well-established in the community.

Considering all this, I might lean towards a local brand, but without specific data, it's hard to be certain. However, based on common knowledge and the fact that global chains might not be as widespread in the North, a local brand could be the answer. But I need to check if there's a well-known one. Maybe ""Java House"" or ""Café 101"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps ""Naija Coffee"" or similar names. However, I might be speculating here.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a single dominant brand, but the question asks for the most popular. Given the lack of",1,,,,1,1.0

New-ch-32,What office software do people typically use in the workplace in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what office software is commonly used in the workplace in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by considering the general trends in office software usage in Africa. Microsoft Office is pretty widespread because it's widely taught in schools and used in many businesses. But I should check if there are any specific factors in Northern Nigeria that might influence this.

Northern Nigeria is part of Nigeria, which is a developing country. In many developing regions, Microsoft Office is still the standard, even though some might use open-source alternatives like LibreOffice or Google Workspace. However, access to internet and subscription services might be a factor. Google Workspace requires reliable internet, which might not be consistent in some areas. LibreOffice is free and open-source, so it's possible some organizations use that, especially if they're looking to cut costs.

Another angle is the presence of international companies or NGOs that might bring in different software. But in a typical workplace, especially in government or local businesses, Microsoft Office is likely the main one. Also, considering that many people in Nigeria use Windows operating systems, which come with Office or have compatibility with it, that reinforces the use of Microsoft Office.

I should also think about any local software or alternatives that might be popular. However, I don't recall any major local office software in Nigeria. So, the most probable answer is Microsoft Office, followed possibly by Google Workspace or LibreOffice in some cases. But the question asks for what people ""typically"" use, so the primary one would be Microsoft Office. However, the answer might include multiple entries. Wait, the user wants the answer as a list in JSON. But the user also says ""provide one single answer as a list form"". So maybe the answer is just Microsoft Office, but perhaps including others if they are common. But I need to be accurate. Maybe in some cases, they use both. But the question is about what's typical. I think the safest answer is Microsoft Office, but I should check if there's a possibility of other software being used more. Alternatively, maybe OpenOffice or LibreOffice. But I think Microsoft Office is the most common. Let me confirm with some sources. Well, without current data, I have to rely on general knowledge. So, I'll go with Microsoft Office as the primary, but maybe also include Google Workspace and LibreOffice as secondary options. However, the user might expect only the most common one. But the answer needs to be a list. So the answer would be [""Microsoft Office"", ""Google Workspace"",",1,,,,1,1.0

New-en-47,What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about Nigerian architecture and culture, especially in the northern regions.

Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so maybe there are elements related to that. I remember that in many parts of Africa, backyards often have plants or animals. Maybe they have vegetable gardens? People might grow their own food. Also, in some cultures, there are traditional structures or items. For example, maybe a well or a place for animals like goats or chickens. 

Wait, I've heard that in some Nigerian homes, especially in the north, there might be a compound with a kitchen area. But the question is about the back garden specifically. Maybe they have trees for shade, like baobab trees? Or perhaps there are fruit trees. Also, in some regions, people use the backyard for outdoor activities or storage. 

Another thought: in Islamic cultures, there might be a prayer area or a simple structure for religious purposes. However, I'm not sure if that's typically in the back garden. Alternatively, maybe there's a place for a latrine or a water storage container. 

Wait, I should check if there's a common element. Maybe the back garden is used for growing crops like yams, tomatoes, or other vegetables. Or perhaps there are livestock kept in the backyard. Also, some homes might have a small garden with herbs or medicinal plants. 

I think the most common answer would be vegetable gardens or crops. But I need to be specific. In Northern Nigeria, common crops include millet, sorghum, and vegetables like okra, eggplant, and tomatoes. So maybe the answer is a vegetable garden or a plot for growing crops. Another possibility is a place for keeping animals, like goats or chickens. 

Alternatively, there might be traditional structures like a mud house or a thatched roof structure. But I think the more typical answer would relate to agriculture. So, the back garden is used for growing food. Let me confirm if that's accurate. Yes, many homes in rural or even some urban areas in Nigeria have small gardens for subsistence farming. So the answer is likely a vegetable garden or a garden with crops. But the user wants one single answer in a list. So maybe ""vegetable garden"" or ""crops"" as the primary item. Alternatively, ""livestock"" like goats. But I think the more common answer is the vegetable garden.",1,,,,1,1.0

Ji-ko-25,What are the family-related holidays in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about family-related holidays in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about Nigerian holidays, especially in the North.

First, I know that Nigeria has both public holidays and traditional or religious ones. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so Islamic holidays would be significant. Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are definitely major ones. These are religious holidays but also family-oriented, with gatherings, feasts, and visiting relatives.

Then there's the Islamic New Year, which is another important date. It's a time for reflection and family activities. Also, the Prophet Muhammad's birthday, known as Mawlid al-Nabi, is celebrated in some regions, though it might not be as widely observed as the Eids. However, in Northern Nigeria, it's possible that some communities observe it.

Another point is the Christmas holiday, even though it's a Christian holiday. In a diverse country like Nigeria, some people might still observe it, especially in mixed communities. But I'm not sure how widespread it is in the North. Maybe it's more of a national holiday than a family one specific to the North.

Then there's the National Day, which is a public holiday but not specifically family-related. The same with Independence Day. However, the user asked for family-related, so maybe those aren't the focus.

Also, there are traditional festivals in some Northern states, like the Durbar in Kano or Sokoto. These are cultural events that involve family and community, but they might not be official holidays. However, the user might be looking for public holidays, so I need to check if these are recognized as official.

Wait, the question is about ""family-related holidays,"" so it's possible that religious holidays like the Eids, Islamic New Year, and Mawlid are the main ones. Also, maybe the end of Ramadan, which is Eid al-Fitr, and the Hajj-related dates, but Eid al-Adha is more about the pilgrimage.

I should confirm if there are any other specific family holidays in Northern Nigeria. For example, some communities might have local festivals or dates, but they might not be widely recognized. Since the user wants a list, I should stick to the major ones that are recognized across the North.

So compiling the list: Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, Islamic New Year, and Mawlid al-Nabi. Christmas might be included if observed, but since the North is mostly Muslim, maybe it's not",1,,,,1,1.0

Jo-sp-13,What is the most popular water sport in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular water sport in Northern Nigeria. Let me think. First, I need to recall what water sports are common in that region. Northern Nigeria is mostly arid or semi-arid, right? So there might not be a lot of natural water bodies like lakes or rivers that are big enough for water sports. Wait, but maybe there are some seasonal rivers or man-made reservoirs?

I know that in many parts of Africa, traditional water activities might be more common than modern sports. For example, fishing is a common activity, but is that considered a sport? Maybe not. Then there's canoeing or kayaking, but I'm not sure if that's popular there. Alternatively, maybe something like swimming, but again, not sure about its popularity as a sport.

Wait, Northern Nigeria has some areas with the Lake Chad Basin. Lake Chad is a significant water body there. So perhaps water sports around Lake Chad? But what specific sports? Maybe fishing is more of an economic activity than a sport. Are there any local water sports that are recognized?

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a sport that's more culturally significant. I remember that in some parts of Nigeria, there's a traditional boat race called ""Canoe Racing"" or ""Egungun"" but I'm not sure if that's in the north. Or maybe ""Pirogues"" which are traditional canoes used in West Africa. But I need to verify if that's considered a sport.

Another angle: maybe the most popular water sport isn't a traditional one. Maybe it's something like swimming or water polo, but I don't think those are widely practiced in the north due to lack of facilities. Or perhaps it's not a sport at all, but the question is tricking me. Wait, the user is asking for a water sport, so it has to be a sport involving water.

Wait, maybe the answer is that there isn't a widely recognized water sport in Northern Nigeria because of the lack of natural water bodies. But the question is phrased as if there is one. Alternatively, maybe the answer is fishing, even though it's more of a livelihood than a sport. But the user might be expecting a different answer.

Alternatively, maybe the most popular is ""Dugout canoe racing"" or some form of traditional boat racing. I think in some regions, they have races using traditional canoes. But I need to confirm if that's specifically in Northern Nigeria. Another",1,,,,1,1.0

New-su-57,What is the most common livestock raised in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the most common livestock in Northern Nigeria. First, I need to recall what I know about livestock in that region. Northern Nigeria is mostly arid or semi-arid, right? So the climate there is probably more suited to certain animals.

I remember that in many parts of Africa, cattle are common, but maybe in the north, they have different animals. Wait, camels are often associated with desert areas. But I also think that goats and sheep are widely raised because they can thrive in drier conditions. 

Wait, but what's the most common? Let me think. In Nigeria, generally, cattle, goats, and sheep are major livestock. But in the northern part, which is more traditional and maybe more focused on pastoralism. I think camels are more common in the Sahel regions, which are part of Northern Nigeria. However, I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, I should verify. Maybe the answer is goats. Because in many parts of Africa, goats are the most common because they are hardy and require less water. Or maybe cattle. Alternatively, maybe the answer is camels. But I think in Nigeria, the main livestock are cattle, goats, and sheep. However, the most common might depend on the specific area. 

Wait, looking up some sources in my mind, I recall that in Northern Nigeria, especially in the Sahel zone, cattle are important, but goats are also very common. However, I think the answer might be goats. Alternatively, maybe the user is looking for cattle. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is sheep. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. In terms of numbers, goats are often more numerous than cattle in many regions because they can be kept in smaller spaces and are more adaptable. So maybe the answer is goats. However, I need to be careful. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is cattle. Because in some contexts, cattle are considered the primary livestock. Wait, but in the north, which is more desert-like, camels might be more common. But I think camels are more associated with the Sahara regions, which are in the northern part of Nigeria. However, I'm not certain. 

Wait, I think the most common livestock in Northern Nigeria is goats. But I need to check if there's a more accurate answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is cattle. Hmm.

New-pe-65,"How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Northern Nigeria? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Nigerian education system.

First, Nigeria has a federal system, so education policies might vary by region. Northern Nigeria is part of the country, and I know that the curriculum might be influenced by both federal and state guidelines. Middle school in Nigeria typically refers to the junior secondary school level, which is grades 1 to 3 (JSS1 to JSS3), right?

The core subjects in Nigerian schools usually include English Language, Mathematics, Basic Science, Social Studies, Civic Education, and maybe others. But I'm not sure if there are variations in the north. Also, there might be religious studies or Islamic Studies in the northern states, especially since some states have introduced Islamic Studies as a compulsory subject. However, I should check if that's part of the middle school curriculum.

Another point is that the Federal Ministry of Education sets the National Curriculum, but states can add their own subjects. So, for example, in the north, Islamic Studies might be included, whereas in the south, it might not be. But I need to confirm if that's the case.

Let me think about the standard subjects. From what I remember, the core subjects in junior secondary school are:

1. English Language
2. Mathematics
3. Basic Science and Technology
4. Social Studies
5. Civic Education
6. Islamic Studies or Christian Religious Knowledge (depending on the region)
7. Physical and Health Education
8. Fine Arts
9. Music
10. Computer Studies
11. Agricultural Science
12. Home Economics
13. French or another foreign language (though this might be optional)
14. Economics

Wait, but some of these might be optional. Also, some schools might offer different subjects based on their resources. However, the question is about the number of subjects taught in middle schools in Northern Nigeria. If Islamic Studies is mandatory in the north, that would be one of the subjects. Also, maybe Arabic Language is taught there.

But I need to find a reliable source or a standard list. Since I can't access external information, I have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I recall, the core subjects in junior secondary schools in Nigeria typically number around 8-10, but with variations based on region and school type.

Wait, the National Curriculum for Basic Education in Nigeria (Junior Secondary) includes the following core subjects:",1,,,,1,1.0

New-en-69,Which writers are commonly studied in literature class in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which writers are commonly studied in literature classes in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about Nigerian literature. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so the literary works might reflect that cultural and religious context.

I remember that Wole Soyinka is a big name in Nigerian literature, but he's from the south, specifically Yorubaland. So maybe he's not as common in Northern schools. Then there's Chinua Achebe, another prominent author from the south, known for ""Things Fall Apart."" But again, that's more associated with the Igbo people in the southeast.

Wait, the question is about Northern Nigeria, which includes Hausa, Fulani, and other ethnic groups. There might be authors who write in Hausa or other local languages. However, literature classes in schools often use English, so maybe the answer includes both English and local language writers.

I think there's a writer named H. O. Attah, but I'm not sure if he's from the North. Another name that comes to mind is Ismaila Alfa, a Nigerian writer from Kano. There's also a poet named S. A. Adeyemi, but I'm not certain about his regional background.

Wait, maybe I should consider the curriculum used in Northern Nigerian schools. The Federal Ministry of Education in Nigeria has a standard curriculum, but regional variations might exist. However, some authors might be more emphasized in the North due to cultural relevance.

I recall that the works of writers like T. S. Eliot and other Western authors are sometimes taught, but that's not specific to the North. For indigenous writers, perhaps those who write in Hausa or other local languages are included, but the question might be looking for English-language authors.

Another possibility is that there are authors from the North who are part of the broader Nigerian literary canon. For example, B. W. Ayodele is a Nigerian author, but I think he's from the south. There's also a writer named Niyi Osundare, but again, not sure about his origin.

Wait, I might be mixing up some names. Let me think again. In the North, there's a literary tradition in Hausa. Writers like Umaru Gambo, who wrote in Hausa, might be studied. Also, there's a poet named Aminu Umar, who wrote in Hausa. But if the question is about literature classes in English, then maybe these Hausa",1,,,,0,0

New-ha-08,What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Northern Nigeria?,"<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking about a food that children in Northern Nigeria typically dislike but the elderly enjoy. Hmm.

First, I need to think about the cuisine of Northern Nigeria. The region is known for dishes like suya, tuwo, groundnut soup, and others. But which of these might be disliked by kids? Maybe something with strong flavors or certain ingredients.

I remember that some traditional dishes use ingredients like onions, tomatoes, or certain spices that might be too intense for children. But wait, there's a specific dish that comes to mind. Maybe ""tuwo"" or ""moin moin""? No, those are more common and not necessarily disliked by children.

Wait, there's a dish called ""dodo"" which is a type of bread made from cassava. But I'm not sure if that's the one. Alternatively, maybe ""koko"" (a porridge made from beans or corn), but I think that's more for breakfast and maybe not disliked by kids.

Another thought: some elderly people might prefer more seasoned or fermented foods. For example, ""suya"" is grilled meat, but that's popular across ages. Maybe ""egusi soup"" which is made with melon seeds. But again, not sure about the age preference.

Wait, there's a dish called ""akara"" which are fried bean cakes. But again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""banga soup"" which is made with palm fruit. But I think that's more of a soup and might not be disliked by children.

Wait, I think I've heard that ""groundnut stew"" or ""groundnut soup"" is something that elderly people prefer, but maybe children don't like the taste. Or maybe ""tuwo"" which is a type of porridge. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe ""koko"" made with cornmeal. But I need to be careful here. Let me think again. Another angle: in some cultures, certain foods are considered more suitable for adults. For example, fermented foods or those with strong flavors. Maybe ""suya"" is too spicy for kids? Or perhaps ""tuwo"" with a lot of seasoning?

Wait, I think the answer might be ""tuwo"" or ""moin moin,"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""koko"" (a type of porridge made from cornmeal). But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe ""dawadawa,"" which is a fermented loc",1,,,,1,1.0

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking where high school students in Northern Nigeria usually go after dinner. First, I need to think about the cultural and social context of Northern Nigeria.

Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so many aspects of daily life are influenced by Islamic traditions. After dinner, which is typically around sunset, students might have some free time. Let me consider common activities. 

In many parts of Nigeria, especially in the north, family time is important. So maybe they go home to their families. But high school students might have some structured activities. Are there study groups? Some might study at home or in the community. However, the question is about where they ""go,"" implying a physical location.

Another possibility is community centers or mosques, but that might be more for adults. Alternatively, they might go to hang out with friends. But in some conservative areas, socializing after dinner might not be common. 

Wait, another angle: in some regions, after dinner, people might gather in the courtyard or outside the house. But that's more of a general practice. However, the question specifies high school students. Maybe they go to study centers or libraries if available. But I'm not sure if that's the most common.

Alternatively, considering the time, after dinner, students might go home, rest, or study. But the answer needs to be specific. Wait, I remember that in some parts of Nigeria, especially in the north, after dinner, people might go to the mosque for evening prayers, but that's more for adults. For students, maybe they go home, or perhaps they have some extracurricular activities. 

Wait, but the answer that's commonly known is that they go to the ""courtyard"" or ""outside the house."" However, I need to verify if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe they go to study with peers. But I think the most likely answer is that they go home. However, the user might be expecting a different answer. Wait, I need to make sure. 

Alternatively, I've heard that in some communities, after dinner, especially in the evenings, students might gather in the community area or go to the market, but that's not specific. Another thought: in the north, after dinner, families often sit together, so students might go to their homes to join family. Therefore, the answer would be they go home. But maybe the answer is more specific.

Ni-en-31,What do people in Northern Nigeria traditionally eat on Christmas Day?,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about what people in Northern Nigeria traditionally eat on Christmas Day. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall the cultural and culinary practices of Northern Nigeria. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so Christmas, being a Christian holiday, might not be as widely celebrated there as it is in the South. However, there could still be some traditional foods that are eaten, maybe influenced by local customs or shared with other communities.

Wait, but I remember that in some parts of Nigeria, even if the population isn't Christian, they might still partake in certain festive foods. However, I'm not sure if Christmas is a major holiday in the North. Maybe they have their own traditional dishes for other occasions. Alternatively, perhaps they might adopt some dishes from the South but with local twists.

Let me consider the typical Northern Nigerian dishes. They often have foods like Tuwo Shinkafa (a type of porridge made from sorghum or millet), Suya (grilled meat skewers), and various stews. But on Christmas, which is a Christian holiday, maybe they might have more Western-style dishes like turkey or ham, but that's more in the South where Christianity is more prevalent. However, since the question is about Northern Nigeria, maybe they don't traditionally eat those. Instead, they might have their own traditional dishes regardless of the holiday.

Alternatively, perhaps they might not have specific Christmas foods and instead eat their regular meals. But the question says ""traditionally eat on Christmas Day,"" so there might be something. Maybe they have a special meal, but I'm not certain. Another angle: in some cases, even if the holiday isn't widely celebrated, people might still prepare special dishes. However, without specific knowledge, it's risky to assume.

Wait, I think in Northern Nigeria, Christmas isn't as significant as in the South, so there might not be traditional Christmas foods. However, if they do have any, it might be similar to other festive occasions. But I'm not sure. Maybe they eat the same as other days, or maybe they have a special dish like a type of porridge or meat dish.
