{""question"":""What is the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Azerbaijan. I need to figure this out. First, I should consider what prenatal education typically includes. Common activities might be classes on nutrition, exercise, childbirth preparation, breastfeeding, and mental health.

Now, Azerbaijan's context. I know that in many countries, prenatal classes are common, but the specific popularity can vary. Maybe I should look into cultural factors. In some cultures, family and community support play a big role, so maybe group classes or workshops are popular. Also, government health programs might influence this.

I recall that in some regions, especially in developing countries, prenatal education might focus more on basic health practices, like proper nutrition and hygiene. However, Azerbaijan has been modernizing its healthcare, so maybe they have structured programs. 

I should check if there are any specific initiatives in Azerbaijan. Maybe the Ministry of Health offers certain programs. Alternatively, NGOs or international organizations might run prenatal education. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) often promotes prenatal care, but I don't know if that's the most popular in Azerbaijan.

Another angle: in many places, childbirth preparation classes are popular. These might include breathing techniques, pain management, and understanding labor stages. But is that the case in Azerbaijan? Or perhaps they focus more on nutritional guidance since diet is crucial during pregnancy.

Wait, I should verify if there's any data or studies on this. If I can't find specific data, I might need to make an educated guess based on common practices. Given that, the most common prenatal education activity globally is often childbirth classes. However, in Azerbaijan, considering cultural aspects, maybe group sessions led by healthcare professionals focusing on nutrition and exercise are more popular.

Alternatively, maybe it's prenatal yoga or other physical activities. But I'm not sure. Without specific information, it's challenging. However, the safest answer based on general trends and the need for structured education might be prenatal classes focusing on childbirth preparation and nutrition. But the user wants one answer. Maybe the most common is prenatal yoga or similar. Wait, but I need to be accurate.

Alternatively, considering Azerbaijan's healthcare system, they might emphasize regular check-ups and medical education. However, the question is about education activities, not medical check-ups. So, perhaps the most popular is attending prenatal classes that cover nutrition, exercise, and childbirth preparation. But how specific can I be?

Since I can't find exact data, I'll go with the most common answer in similar contexts,",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, I need to figure out how long on average people in Azerbaijan spend having dinner at a restaurant. Let's start by considering factors that might influence this.

First, cultural norms. In many countries, dinner is a social event, and the duration can vary. In some places, people might linger longer, while in others, it's more about efficiency. Azerbaijan is a country with a mix of Eastern and Western influences. I recall that in some Middle Eastern and Central Asian cultures, meals can be more leisurely, but I'm not sure about the exact average.

Next, looking at restaurant types. There are casual dining places where people might eat quickly, and upscale restaurants where meals could take longer. However, the question is about an average, so it might be a general figure that includes various types of establishments.

I should check if there are any studies or surveys on dining durations in Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific data right now. But maybe I can infer based on neighboring countries or similar cultures. For example, in Turkey, the average dinner duration might be around 1.5 to 2 hours. If Azerbaijan is similar, maybe the average is in that range.

Also, considering the pace of life in Baku, the capital. If it's a bustling city, people might eat faster. However, traditional meals like plov or kebabs might take longer to eat, especially if they're served in larger portions. But again, this is speculative.

Another angle: restaurant service times. In some places, the average time per customer can be influenced by how long it takes to serve the meal and the number of courses. If it's a two-course meal, maybe 1.5 hours. If it's a full course meal with more courses, it could be longer. However, without specific data, this is just a guess.

I should also think about any available data from tourism sites or restaurant industry reports. For instance, if a restaurant in Azerbaijan has an average of 1.5 hours per table, that might be the figure. But again, I don't have concrete numbers.

Since I can't find exact data, I might have to make an educated guess based on similar countries. Let's say the average is around 1.5 to 2 hours. To be safe, maybe 1.8 hours? But I need to check if there's a more accurate estimation. Alternatively, if I consider that in many Western countries, dinner might be 1-2 hours,",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani students studying overseas.

First, I remember that many students from Azerbaijan go to countries like Russia, Turkey, and sometimes European nations. But what fields are they pursuing? I think there's a lot of interest in engineering, maybe computer science or IT. Also, business and economics might be popular because of the country's economic development and need for skilled professionals in those areas.

Wait, I've heard that Azerbaijani students often study medicine abroad, perhaps in countries like Ukraine or Russia. But is that the most common? Or maybe it's more about technical fields. Another angle: the oil and gas industry is significant in Azerbaijan, so maybe petroleum engineering or related fields are popular. However, I'm not sure if that's the case.

I should also consider the availability of programs. For example, some universities in Russia and Turkey have strong programs in engineering and business. Also, with the rise of technology, computer science and IT might be on the rise. But I need to check which one is the most common.

Looking up some data in my mind, I think that business administration and economics are among the top choices. However, another thought: maybe law? But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe there's a trend towards studying in English-speaking countries, which could influence the fields they choose, like international relations or management.

Wait, I recall that in recent years, there's been an increase in students studying computer science and information technology, especially with the growth of the tech sector globally. But again, I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about engineering in general, such as mechanical or electrical engineering.

Another possibility is that the most common profession is actually ""engineering"" in general, but if I have to specify, maybe ""computer science and information technology"" is more precise. However, if I'm not certain, I should go with the most commonly cited answer. From what I've read before, business and economics are often mentioned as popular fields for Azerbaijani students studying abroad. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should go with business administration as the answer, but I need to confirm.

{""question"":""What is the most preferred recreational facility among children in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most preferred recreational facility among children in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of urban and rural areas. The capital is Baku. Now, recreational facilities for children can vary based on cultural preferences, availability, and maybe even climate.

First, I should consider common recreational facilities in many countries. Parks, playgrounds, sports centers, maybe zoos or museums. But which one is most preferred? In some places, playgrounds with swings and slides are popular. In others, maybe sports facilities like soccer fields or skate parks. 

Azerbaijan has a relatively young population, so maybe outdoor activities are important. Also, considering the climate, summers can be hot, so maybe indoor facilities? But I'm not sure. Let me think about any specific info I might have. 

I remember that Azerbaijan has some large parks, like the Heydar Aliyev Park in Baku, which is a big green space. Maybe those are popular. Also, there might be a focus on traditional activities. However, I'm not certain if that's the case. Another angle: maybe looking at government initiatives or surveys. For example, if there's a national survey on children's preferences, but I don't have that data.

Alternatively, maybe looking at the availability of facilities. If there are many playgrounds, they might be the most common. Or perhaps sports facilities, given that sports are often promoted in many cultures. However, without specific data, it's hard to be certain. 

Another thought: in some countries, video game arcades or internet cafes are popular among youth, but I don't know if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Also, considering the economic factors, maybe access to such facilities is limited. 

Wait, I should check if there's any information on this. But since I can't access external sources, I need to rely on existing knowledge. From what I know, in many countries, parks and playgrounds are the most accessible and preferred recreational spots for children. Azerbaijan's parks might be a good bet here. However, there's also the possibility of sports facilities being more preferred if there's a strong emphasis on sports in the education system or culture.

Alternatively, maybe indoor recreational centers or amusement parks. For example, if there's a large amusement park, that could be a top choice. But I'm not sure if Azerbaijan has such a prominent one.

What is a popular second language for high school students in Azerbaijan?Provide one single answer as a list form at the end in a JSON format as below. Only the answer should be given with the list, without any examples.

{""question"":""What is a popular second language for high school students in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a popular second language for high school students in Azerbaijan. First, I need to recall what I know about Azerbaijan's education system and languages.

Azerbaijan's official language is Azerbaijani, which is a Turkic language. However, since the country has a history of Soviet influence, Russian was widely taught and used for a long time. Even after gaining independence in 1991, Russian remained an important second language, especially in education and government.

Now, considering high school students, the curriculum might include foreign languages. In many post-Soviet countries, English is increasingly becoming a popular second language due to globalization and the influence of Western education. So, I should check if English is taught in Azerbaijani high schools. Also, maybe other languages like French or German, but I think English is more common.

Wait, but the question is about a popular second language. So, in addition to Russian, which has historical roots, English might be the more current popular choice. Some sources might say that Russian is still widely taught, but perhaps English is becoming more prominent. However, I need to confirm which one is more popular now.

Looking up some information (even though I can't browse the internet), I remember that in Azerbaijan, Russian is still a significant second language, especially for older generations, but younger students might be leaning more towards English. However, in the education system, Russian might still be a required subject. But maybe the question is pointing towards a different answer. Alternatively, maybe it's French or another language. Wait, but I think the most common second languages taught in schools there are Russian and English. Given that, which one is more popular? Since the country is part of the Turkic Council and has ties with Turkey, maybe Turkish is also taught. But Turkish is a related language, but not sure if it's a second language in schools.

Alternatively, considering the Baku International School or other international schools, they might teach English. But for the general high school system, perhaps Russian is still the primary second language. However, I think that in recent years, there's a push towards English as a global language. So maybe the answer is English. But I need to be sure. Let me think again. The official languages are Azerbaijani and Russian (though Russian is not official anymore, but it's still widely used). So in schools, students might study Russian as a second language. However, English is also being",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What do people from Azerbaijan eat in Eid ul Fitr?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people in Azerbaijan eat during Eid ul Fitr. First, I should recall what Eid ul Fitr is. It's the Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, so it's a time for feasting and celebration. Now, Azerbaijani cuisine has its own unique dishes, so I need to think about traditional foods there.

I know that in many Muslim countries, sweets and pastries are common during Eid. Maybe something like baklava? But I'm not sure if that's specific to Azerbaijan. Also, there's a dish called ""pilaf,"" which is a type of rice dish. I think Azerbaijani pilaf might be a staple. Then there are various meat dishes, maybe lamb or chicken. 

Another thing is that during festive occasions, people might prepare specific desserts. For example, ""shekerbura"" is a sweet Azerbaijani pastry. Also, ""gulab jamun"" is a dessert that's popular in some regions, but I'm not certain if it's eaten there. 

I should also consider the main courses. Maybe ""kufte"" (meatballs) or ""dolma"" (stuffed grape leaves). But I'm not sure if these are specifically for Eid. Another possibility is ""shish kebab,"" but that's more of a general dish. 

Wait, I remember that during Eid, families gather and have large meals. So the answer might include a variety of dishes like pilaf, meat dishes, and sweets. Let me check some sources. Oh, right, ""pilaf"" is definitely a main dish. Then ""sığır göbleri"" (beef tongue) is a traditional dish, but maybe not for Eid. 

Alternatively, ""qutlama"" is a type of dumpling that's popular in Azerbaijan. Also, ""tavuk göğsü"" is a dessert made from chicken breast, but that's more of a specific dessert. 

I think the main answer would include pilaf, various meats like lamb or chicken, and sweets like shekerbura or baklava. Maybe also ""dolma"" and ""kufte."" But I need to make sure these are specifically eaten during Eid ul Fitr in Azerbaijan. 

Another angle: during Eid, people might prepare special dishes to share with family and friends. So the list would include traditional main dishes and desserts. I'll go with pilaf, meat dishes (l",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What are the required subjects in Azerbaijan's university entrance exam?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the required subjects for Azerbaijan's university entrance exam. Let me start by recalling what I know about the education system there. Azerbaijan uses a centralized exam system, similar to other countries with standardized testing. The main exam is called the ""Gənclər Universiteti Giriş İmtihanı"" or maybe something else? Wait, I think it's the ""Higher Education Admission Exam.""

From what I remember, in many countries, the entrance exams for university include subjects like mathematics, Azerbaijani language, and sometimes a foreign language. Also, depending on the field of study, there might be additional subjects. For example, students applying to technical universities might need physics and chemistry, while those going into medical fields might need biology.

But I need to confirm the exact subjects required for the entrance exam in Azerbaijan. Let me think if there's any official information. I recall that the exam is conducted by the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University or another educational authority. The main subjects are likely Azerbaijani language, mathematics, and a foreign language, which is usually English. Additionally, there might be a subject based on the student's chosen field of study. For example, if someone is applying to a technical university, they might have to take physics and chemistry. However, I need to check if these are part of the entrance exam or if they are part of the secondary school curriculum.

Wait, the entrance exam might consist of three main subjects: Azerbaijani language, mathematics, and a foreign language (English). Then, for specific majors, there could be additional subject tests. But the question is about the required subjects in the entrance exam, so maybe the core ones are the three I mentioned. However, I'm not entirely sure if the foreign language is mandatory for all students or just those applying to certain programs.

I should also consider that the exam might have different components. For instance, some sources mention that the entrance exam includes Azerbaijani language, mathematics, and a foreign language (English), and then another subject depending on the field of study. But the question is asking for the required subjects, so perhaps the mandatory ones are Azerbaijani, math, and English, and then an additional subject based on the major. However, the answer might list the core subjects only, not the additional ones.

Alternatively, maybe the required subjects are Azerbaijani language, mathematics, and a foreign language (English), and then another subject like physics or chemistry if the student is applying to a specific faculty",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, the user is asking about the most popular stew in Azerbaijan. Let me think. I know that Azerbaijani cuisine has several traditional dishes. Stews are common, like pilafs and various meat dishes.

Wait, there's a dish called ""plov"" which is a type of rice pilaf, but is that considered a stew? Maybe not. Then there's ""dolma,"" which are stuffed vegetables, but again, not a stew. 

Another possibility is ""kəbab,"" but that's more like grilled meat. Hmm. Oh, I remember reading about ""tavuk göğsü,"" which is a chicken breast stew. But is that the most popular? Or maybe ""qovurma,"" which is a meat and vegetable stew. 

Wait, I think ""qovurma"" is more of a general term for stews. But I'm not sure about the most popular one. Let me verify. Some sources mention ""tavuk göğsü"" as a traditional stew made with chicken, yogurt, and vegetables. However, another common stew is ""qazma,"" which is made with lamb and vegetables. 

Alternatively, ""pilaf"" is a staple, but it's a rice dish. Maybe ""qara qazma"" (black qazma) is a popular version. But I'm getting confused. I need to find the most commonly cited stew. 

After checking some references, it seems that ""tavuk göğsü"" is often highlighted as a traditional and popular stew in Azerbaijan. However, I'm not 100% certain. Another possibility is ""qovurma"" as a general stew. But I think the answer they're looking for is ""tavuk göğsü."" Alternatively, maybe ""qazma"" is more common. 

Wait, perhaps ""qara qazma"" is the most popular. But I need to confirm. Let me think again. In some sources, ""qazma"" is mentioned as a traditional stew with lamb, and ""tavuk göğsü"" is also a favorite. However, since the question asks for the most popular, maybe it's ""qazma.""

{""question"":""Who is the most well known and successful entrepreneur in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking who the most well-known and successful entrepreneur in Azerbaijan is. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall prominent entrepreneurs from Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has a few notable business figures, especially in sectors like energy, banking, and telecommunications. 

One name that comes to mind is Heydar Aliyev. Wait, no, he was a political leader, not an entrepreneur. Maybe I confused him with someone else. Let me check again.

Another possibility is Rashad Akhundov. He's the founder of Azercell, which is Azerbaijan's leading mobile operator. Azercell is a major company, so he might be a strong candidate. But is he the most well-known?

Then there's Samir Sultanov, who is the founder of Azeri Holding, a large conglomerate involved in various industries. Azeri Holding has significant influence in the country, so Sultanov might be another name to consider.

Also, there's Araz Azimov, the founder of Azad Bank, which is one of the largest banks in Azerbaijan. Banking is a crucial sector, so his contributions could make him a top entrepreneur.

But I need to verify which of these individuals is the most recognized. Sometimes, political connections can influence visibility, but the user is asking about entrepreneurship specifically. 

Rashad Akhundov's Azercell has been around since the 1990s and has expanded internationally, which might contribute to his prominence. Samir Sultanov's Azeri Holding is also very influential, but perhaps less internationally known compared to Azercell.

Another angle: sometimes, the most successful might be the one with the largest company or the most assets. However, without current financial data, it's tricky. 

I should also consider if there are any other entrepreneurs in recent years. For example, could there be someone from the tech sector? But I don't recall any major tech entrepreneurs from Azerbaijan besides those in telecom or banking.

Given the information I have, Rashad Akhundov and Samir Sultanov are both leading candidates. But which one is more well-known? Maybe Rashad Akhundov is more internationally recognized due to Azercell's presence in multiple countries. However, in Azerbaijan, Samir Sultanov might have a larger influence through his conglomerate.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is Samir Sultanov because his company is more diversified and has a bigger footprint in the domestic market. But I'm not",1,,,0,0

Okay, I need to figure out the most popular weekday evening family activity in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of cultures from both the Middle East and Eastern Europe. 

First, I should consider common family activities in similar regions. In many countries, evenings might involve dining out, watching TV, or religious activities. But since the question specifies a weekday evening, maybe it's something that's done regularly after work or school.

I remember that in some Muslim-majority countries, Friday is a day of prayer, but the question is about a weekday, not Friday. So maybe not religious activities specifically. However, maybe there's a general trend towards family time in the evenings. 

Another angle: Azerbaijan has a rich cultural heritage. Maybe traditional music or dance? But those might be more specific events rather than a daily activity. 

Looking at leisure activities, maybe going to a park or having family dinners at home. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular. Alternatively, watching TV or movies at home could be common. However, I need to check if there's a specific activity that's more prevalent there.

Wait, I think in some countries, especially in the Caucasus, people might gather for tea time in the evenings. But is that considered a family activity? Tea time is common in many cultures, but I'm not certain if it's the most popular in Azerbaijan specifically.

Alternatively, maybe they have family dinners together. In many cultures, having dinner as a family is a common evening activity. But is that the case in Azerbaijan? Also, considering work schedules, maybe after work, families come together for meals.

Another thought: Azerbaijan has a growing middle class, and maybe they enjoy going out to restaurants or cafes on weekdays. But again, that's more of an individual choice rather than a family activity.

I should verify if there are any sources or common knowledge about this. From what I've read before, in Azerbaijan, family dinners are important, and evenings might be spent together at home. However, I'm not entirely sure if that's the most popular. Another possibility is that they watch TV together, given the popularity of TV shows and family time.

But to be precise, I need to make sure. Since I can't look it up right now, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. Considering the cultural emphasis on family, perhaps the most common activity is having dinner together at home in the evenings. That",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""How long is the typical probation period for new employees before signing a formal contract in Azerbaijan? (e.g., 1 month)."",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the typical probation period for new employees in Azerbaijan before signing a formal contract. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall the labor laws in Azerbaijan. From what I remember, Azerbaijan's labor code might have specific regulations regarding probation periods. I think the probation period is usually agreed upon between the employer and the employee. But there might be a maximum limit set by law.

I believe the maximum probation period allowed by law in Azerbaijan is three months. However, this can vary depending on the type of position or the terms of the employment contract. For example, some positions might have a shorter probation period, like one or two months, while others might go up to three. But the law probably doesn't allow it to be longer than three months. 

Wait, I should check if there are any exceptions. Maybe for certain roles or industries, the probation period could be different. But the standard or typical period is likely around one to three months. However, the user is asking for the typical period, so maybe the average is one month? But I need to be precise here. 

Wait, according to the Labor Code of Azerbaijan, the probation period can be up to three months, but the employer and employee can agree on a shorter period. So the typical might be around one to two months, but the maximum is three. However, the question is about the typical, not the maximum. 

But maybe the answer is that the probation period can be up to three months as per the law, but the common practice might be one month. However, I need to make sure. If the law allows up to three, but employers often use one month, then the answer should reflect that. However, without specific data on common practice, it's safer to state the legal maximum. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the probation period is typically one month, but the law allows up to three. However, the user might be looking for the legal maximum. But the question says ""typical,"" so perhaps the answer is one month. But I'm not entirely sure. 

I should verify the exact legal provision. The Labor Code of Azerbaijan, Article 43, states that the probation period can be up to three months, and it's agreed upon in the employment contract. So the maximum is three months, but the typical could vary. However, the question is about the typical period, which might be commonly one month.

{""question"":""What eating utensils do people commonly used in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what eating utensils are commonly used in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and cuisine. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their cuisine is influenced by both Middle Eastern and Central Asian traditions. 

First, I remember that in many Middle Eastern countries, people use flatbread like lavash or馕 (nan). So maybe they use a knife and fork for eating meat or other dishes, but also have specific utensils for certain foods. Wait, but in some cultures, they use their hands for eating certain dishes, like with rice or specific meats. However, I think in Azerbaijan, they might use more traditional utensils.

Then there's the question of spoons. In many countries, spoons are common for soups or stews. Azerbaijan has dishes like dolma (stuffed vegetables) or plov (a type of rice dish), which might be eaten with a spoon or a fork. Also, considering the use of hands, maybe for eating with bread, which is common in many regions.

Wait, but the question is about utensils. So I need to list the utensils, not the food. Let me think. In Azerbaijan, people might use a knife, fork, and spoon, similar to Western countries, but maybe with some traditional variations. Also, there's the possibility of using a specific type of fork or knife, but I'm not sure. Another thought: in some cultures, they use a small knife for cutting food, especially meat, and then eat with a fork or spoon. 

Also, considering the use of bread, which is a staple, people might use a knife to cut the bread and then eat it with their hands, but the utensils would still be the knife and fork. Wait, but maybe they use a fork to eat certain dishes. Let me check if there's any specific utensil unique to Azerbaijan. For example, in some countries, they have a specific type of spoon or fork, but I don't recall any specific ones for Azerbaijan.

Another angle: when dining in restaurants, they might use the standard Western utensils. However, in traditional settings, maybe they use more hand-eating, but the question is about utensils. So probably the answer is knife, fork, and spoon. But I need to confirm. Maybe also a ladle for soups? Or a specific type of spoon for certain dishes.

{""question"":""What type of alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking what type of alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Azerbaijan. I need to figure this out.

First, I know that Azerbaijan has a rich culture with various traditions. They have a history with wine production, but I'm not sure if that's the main one now. Also, there's a drink called ""shirin"" which is a type of sweet wine, but maybe that's more traditional. Then there's ""kumis,"" which is fermented mare's milk, but that's more of a traditional drink, not sure if it's common at festivals. 

Wait, maybe vodka? In many Eastern European countries, vodka is popular. But Azerbaijan is in the Caucasus region. They might have their own local spirits. There's also ""bağlama"" which is a type of wine. But I'm not certain. Another possibility is ""arak,"" which is a type of spirit similar to brandy, but I think that's more common in the Middle East. 

Alternatively, maybe beer? In many festivals, beer is a common drink. But is it the most common in Azerbaijan? I should check if there's a specific drink associated with their festivals. 

Wait, I remember that Azerbaijan has a tradition of drinking ""shirin"" or ""khosh"" which are types of wine. But maybe at festivals, they might consume more of a local spirit. Alternatively, maybe they drink ""chay"" which is tea, but that's non-alcoholic. 

Alternatively, considering the region, maybe they consume more of a local brandy or spirit. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. In some sources, I think the most common alcoholic drink in Azerbaijan is actually vodka, but I'm not entirely certain. However, another angle is that they produce a lot of wine, so maybe wine is more common. 

Wait, looking up in my mind, I think that in Azerbaijan, especially at festivals, they might have a local spirit called ""shampan"" which is a type of sparkling wine. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the most common is ""vodka"" or ""arak."" 

Alternatively, I should think about the most popular alcoholic beverages in the country. According to some knowledge, Azerbaijan has a significant production of wine, and it's a traditional drink. But also, they have a strong culture of drinking vodka. However, I need to be accurate here.

{""question"":""Who is the most popular sportperson in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking who the most popular sportsperson in Azerbaijan is. Let me think about this.

First, I need to consider which sports are popular in Azerbaijan. They have a strong tradition in wrestling, especially Freestyle wrestling. Then there's boxing, football (soccer), and maybe some other sports like weightlifting or judo.

I remember that Azerbaijani wrestlers have done well in international competitions. For example, Hidayat Heydarov is a notable wrestler who won a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics. That might make him a popular figure. But I should check if there are others who might be more popular.

In boxing, there's Vasyl Lomachenko, but he's from Ukraine, not Azerbaijan. Wait, no, I think there's another boxer from Azerbaijan. Maybe Magomedrasul Majidov? He's a middleweight champion. He's had some high-profile fights, which could make him popular.

Football is a big sport there too. Players like Samir Kassai, who plays for the national team, might have a large following. But I'm not sure if he's the most popular overall. Maybe someone with more international recognition?

Then there's weightlifting. The country has produced some champions like Iryna Klymchuk, but she's a female athlete. Popularity might vary by gender, but the question doesn't specify.

Another name that comes to mind is Rafael Aghayev, a wrestler who won an Olympic gold in 2012. He's been a prominent figure in Azerbaijani sports. But Hidayat Heydarov's 2016 gold might have made him more recent and popular.

I should also consider if there are any athletes who have gained fame through social media or other platforms. However, without current data, it's hard to say. But based on Olympic achievements and media coverage, wrestlers like Heydarov and Aghayev are likely top candidates.

Between them, Hidayat Heydarov might be more popular because of his recent Olympic success. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe a footballer like Rashad Sadygov, who plays for the national team and has been in the news for his performances.

Wait, but the question is about the most popular. Popularity can be subjective, but in terms of medals and international recognition, wrestlers and boxers are more likely. Since I can't look up current",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that Azerbaijan is a country with a rich culinary tradition, influenced by both Middle Eastern and Central Asian cuisines. They have a lot of dishes that use ingredients like rice, lamb, and various spices.

Now, focusing on desserts. I know that many countries in the Caucasus and the Middle East have desserts that are similar, like baklava, which is a common pastry made with layers of dough, butter, and syrup, often filled with nuts. But is baklava the most popular in Azerbaijan specifically?

Wait, there's also a dessert called ""shekerbura,"" which I think is a type of sweet roll or bread. Maybe that's popular too. Or perhaps ""pilaf"" but that's more of a main dish. Then there's ""manti,"" which are dumplings, but again, more savory.

I should verify if baklava is indeed the most popular. Maybe there's another dessert unique to Azerbaijan. Let me think. There's also ""gogal,"" which is a sweet made with semolina and syrup, sometimes called ""Azerbaijani halva."" But I'm not sure if that's the most popular.

Alternatively, ""sahlab"" is a dessert made from orchid root, milk, and sugar, but it might be more of a specific regional dish. Another possibility is ""karakoch,"" which is a type of sweet roll. But I'm not certain.

I think baklava is widely recognized and popular in Azerbaijan, similar to other countries in the region. However, maybe there's a local variation. Alternatively, ""shekerbura"" might be more commonly consumed as a traditional dessert. Wait, I should check some sources or common knowledge. From what I recall, baklava is indeed a staple in Azerbaijani desserts, often served during holidays and special occasions. It's made with layers of phyllo dough, filled with nuts, and soaked in syrup. So it's possible that baklava is the answer here. But I need to be sure. Another thought: sometimes ""halva"" is considered a popular dessert, but I think in Azerbaijan, it might be called ""gogal"" or ""muhallabiyeh.""

Okay, so the user is asking for the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall if there's any well-known Christmas songs specific to Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan is a country with a mix of cultures, including Muslim traditions, so Christmas might not be as widely celebrated as in Christian countries. However, there might still be some popular songs.

I remember that in many countries, especially those with a Christian majority, Christmas carols like ""Jingle Bells"" or ""Silent Night"" are common. But in Azerbaijan, maybe there are local adaptations or translations. I should check if there's a specific song that's commonly played during the holidays there. Alternatively, maybe a popular Azerbaijani song that's associated with Christmas.

Wait, I'm not sure if there's an official or most popular Christmas song. Maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific one, but the user is expecting a song title. Alternatively, perhaps ""Azerbaijan"" has a Christmas song that's popular, but I can't recall the name. Maybe it's a translated version of a Western song. Another angle: sometimes countries have their own traditional songs, but I don't have information on that.

I should verify if there's any data on popular Christmas songs in Azerbaijan. Since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I think the answer might be that there isn't a widely recognized Christmas song specific to Azerbaijan, but the user might expect a song title. Alternatively, maybe ""Noel"" or a similar term is used, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the most popular is a song that's played during the holiday season, even if it's not specifically a Christmas song. But the question is about the most popular Christmas song. Since I can't find specific information, maybe the safest answer is that there isn't a specific song, but the user might expect a name. However, I need to provide an answer. Maybe ""Azerbaijan's Christmas Song"" or ""Merry Christmas"" in Azerbaijani? Wait, the user might be looking for a specific title. Alternatively, maybe a song by a local artist. For example, ""Yeni Yil"" (New Year) is a common song, but that's for New Year, not Christmas. Since Christmas is not widely observed, maybe there's no specific song.

Okay, so I need to figure out which sports event Azerbaijanis support the most in international competitions. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's sports culture. 

First, Azerbaijan is a country that has produced several notable athletes, especially in combat sports. I remember that they have a strong presence in wrestling, particularly in Greco-Roman wrestling. They've had champions like Haji Aliyev and others. Also, judo is another sport where they've been successful. 

But wait, the question is about the sports event they support the most, not just the sports they excel in. So maybe it's not just about the sports they're good at, but which events they follow passionately. 

Another angle: national pride. When a country has athletes who win medals, people tend to support those events more. Azerbaijan has had success in the Olympics and other international competitions. For example, in the Olympics, wrestlers and boxers have won medals. But is there a particular event or sport that stands out?

Looking at the sports they invest in, Azerbaijan has a strong wrestling program. They have a lot of wrestlers competing in international events like the World Championships and the Olympics. Also, they have a strong boxing tradition. But I'm not sure which one is more passionately supported.

Wait, I think in recent years, Azerbaijani athletes have been making a name in wrestling and judo. However, the question is about the sports event, not the sport itself. So maybe it's the Olympic Games? Because that's a major international competition where their athletes compete. 

Alternatively, maybe it's specific events within a sport. For example, the European Championships or World Championships in wrestling. But I'm not certain. 

Another thought: sometimes countries support events that are held in their country. But the question is about international competitions, so it's about events outside Azerbaijan. 

I think the most likely answer is wrestling, especially Greco-Roman wrestling, because Azerbaijan has had consistent success there. However, I should confirm if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's boxing. 

Wait, looking up some sources in my mind: Azerbaijan has produced multiple Olympic medalists in wrestling. For example, Haji Aliyev and others have won golds. Also, judo has been a strong point too, with athletes like Lasha Shavdatuashvili. But I think wrestling might be more prominent.

{""question"":""At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the age at which children in Azerbaijan typically become independent from their parents. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, and their culture might have certain traditions regarding when children leave home.

First, I should consider general trends. In many Western countries, the age of independence is around 18-21, but in some cultures, especially in more traditional societies, it might be later. However, Azerbaijan has been undergoing some modernization, so maybe it's somewhere in between.

I remember that in some Middle Eastern countries, children might stay with their parents until marriage, which could be in the late 20s. But I'm not sure about Azerbaijan specifically. Maybe I should check if there are any official statistics or cultural practices. However, since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

Another angle: education. In Azerbaijan, the typical school system might have children finish education around 18. But higher education might take longer, so maybe some stay until they finish university, which could be around 22. However, independence isn't solely tied to education. Also, economic factors play a role. If the economy is strong, maybe young people can move out earlier, but if not, they might depend on parents longer.

I think in many post-Soviet countries, there's a trend where children leave home around 18-20, but sometimes they stay longer. However, considering cultural norms, maybe the average is around 20-22. But I'm not certain. Wait, I've heard that in some parts of the Caucasus, it's common for children to live with parents until marriage, which might be later. However, urban vs. rural differences might exist. In cities, perhaps earlier independence, while in rural areas, later.

But the question is about typical age. If I can't find exact data, maybe the answer is around 20. However, I need to be careful. Let me think again. In some sources, the age of majority in Azerbaijan is 18, but that's legal age, not necessarily when they become independent. So maybe the answer is 20 or 22. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to other countries in the region. For example, in Turkey, it's common for people to leave home around 20-22. So perhaps Azerbaijan is similar.

Okay, I need to figure out what is typically given as a congratulatory gesture at a friend's wedding in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling any knowledge I have about Azerbaijani culture and wedding traditions.

First, I know that in many cultures, gifts are given at weddings, but the type of gift can vary. In some places, money is common, while in others, it might be household items or symbolic gifts. Azerbaijan has a rich cultural heritage influenced by both Eastern and Western traditions. 

I remember that in some parts of the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan, it's customary to give money as a gift, often in a decorative form. Maybe something like a red envelope, similar to Chinese traditions, but I'm not sure if that's specific to Azerbaijan. Alternatively, they might give gifts that are practical for the new couple, like kitchenware or bedding. 

Wait, I think in Azerbaijani weddings, guests often give money as a gift. It's called ""hadiye"" or ""meşrul"" in Azerbaijani. The money is usually given in a special envelope, and sometimes the amount is symbolic. However, I should confirm if there's a specific item or practice unique to Azerbaijan. 

Another angle: sometimes in weddings, guests might give something that symbolizes good luck or prosperity. For example, in some cultures, giving a plant like a potted plant or a tree is a symbol of growth and lasting love. But I'm not certain if that's common in Azerbaijan. 

Alternatively, maybe they give gifts that are traditional Azerbaijani items, like embroidered textiles or jewelry. However, since the question specifies a congratulatory gesture when attending, it's more likely to be a monetary gift rather than a physical item. 

I should check if there's a specific term or item. Let me think. In some sources, I recall that in Azerbaijan, guests often present money in a red envelope, similar to the Chinese tradition of ""hongbao,"" but I'm not entirely sure. However, I need to be cautious about cultural generalizations. 

Alternatively, maybe they give a gift card or a check, but that's more Western. In traditional settings, cash is more common. So, putting it all together, the most probable answer is that guests give money as a congratulatory gift, typically in a decorative envelope. 

But I need to ensure that this is indeed the case. If I'm not 100% certain, maybe the answer is just money. Let",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What animals are commonly used for agriculture in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what animals are commonly used for agriculture in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about agriculture in that region. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus, known for its diverse geography, including mountains, steppes, and coastal areas. Their agriculture would likely include both livestock and crops.

First, livestock. In many countries, cattle are common for dairy and meat. Sheep and goats are also typical for wool, milk, and meat. Pigs might be present, but maybe not as much in some regions. Then there's poultry like chickens for eggs and meat. Horses could be used for farming or transportation, though maybe more in rural areas. Camels might be used in certain regions, but I'm not sure about Azerbaijan specifically. Also, maybe some smaller animals like rabbits or bees for honey?

Now, checking specific information about Azerbaijan. I remember that Azerbaijan has a significant number of cattle, sheep, and goats. They are probably the main livestock for agriculture. Poultry is also common. Horses might be used in some traditional farming practices. I should verify if camels are used there. Maybe not as much as in desert regions. Also, donkeys might be used for labor in some areas.

Another angle: looking at the main agricultural products. Azerbaijan produces wheat, fruits, vegetables, and grapes. Livestock would support these through manure for fertilizers. So the primary animals would be those that contribute to both food production and farm work. Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry are likely. Horses and maybe donkeys for plowing or transportation.

I should make sure not to include animals that aren't traditionally used there. For example, alpacas are more common in South America, so probably not in Azerbaijan. So compiling the list: cattle, sheep, goats, poultry (chickens), horses, and maybe donkeys. Wait, but I need to confirm if donkeys are commonly used in Azerbaijan's agriculture. Some sources might mention them, but maybe not as primary. Alternatively, maybe pigs are more common in certain regions. However, in many Muslim countries, pork isn't as common due to religious reasons, so pigs might be less prevalent.

So the main ones would be cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, and horses. Let me check a reliable source in my mind. The FAO or agricultural reports on Azerbaijan. From what I recall, the country has a large number of sheep and goats, especially in the mountainous regions.",1,,,1,0.25

{""question"":""When is the first day that people celebrate after a child is born in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out when the first day of celebration is after a child is born in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling any cultural or traditional practices I know about Azerbaijan. I remember that in many cultures, there are specific days or events following a birth, like a naming ceremony or a celebration on the first day. 

Wait, I think in some countries, like in parts of the Middle East or Central Asia, there's a tradition called ""Asha"" or ""Aşı"" which is a celebration held on the 40th day after the birth. But the question is about the first day, not the 40th. Maybe I'm mixing up the days here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific day immediately after birth. In some cultures, the first day is celebrated with a small gathering or a feast. But I'm not sure about Azerbaijan specifically. Let me check my memory. 

I recall that in Azerbaijani culture, the 40th day is significant, known as ""Qurban Bayramı"" or ""Aşı"", but that's a big celebration. However, the first day might be more about a naming ceremony. Wait, sometimes the naming ceremony happens on the first day, but I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a tradition where the family gathers on the first day, but I need to confirm. Another angle: in some cultures, the celebration happens on the seventh day, but again, not sure for Azerbaijan. 

Wait, I think the answer might be the 40th day, but the question is about the first day. Maybe the first day is not a specific celebration but the 40th is. However, the user is asking for the first day after birth, so maybe it's the day of birth, but that's the actual birth day, not a celebration. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a tradition of celebrating on the first day of the month following the birth, but I don't think that's it. 

Wait, I need to be precise. Let me think again. In Azerbaijani culture, the 40th day is considered a significant day for the child's well-being, so the family might have a ceremony on that day. But the first day after birth would be the day of birth itself, but that's the actual day the child is born, not a celebration. 

Alternatively, maybe the first celebration is the 7th day, but I'm not sure.

{""question"":""What symbolic food do people from Azerbaijan eat on (Lunar) New Year?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the symbolic food that people in Azerbaijan eat during the Lunar New Year. Let me think. Wait, first, does Azerbaijan even celebrate the Lunar New Year? Because I know that Azerbaijan is a country where the majority of people are Muslim, and they follow the Islamic calendar, which is based on lunar months. However, the Lunar New Year is a Chinese tradition, right? It's celebrated by Chinese and other East Asian communities. But maybe there's a connection or a specific dish that's eaten during a similar festive period in Azerbaijan?

Hmm, maybe the user is confusing the Lunar New Year with another holiday. In Azerbaijan, the main New Year is the Gregorian New Year on January 1st. But there's also the Nowruz, which is a spring festival celebrated on the vernal equinox, around March 20th or 21st. Nowruz is a significant holiday in Azerbaijan, and it's also celebrated in other countries like Iran and parts of Central Asia. Nowruz has its own traditional foods. So perhaps the user is referring to Nowruz instead of the Lunar New Year?

If that's the case, the symbolic foods for Nowruz in Azerbaijan include things like plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), sumalak (a wheat-based porridge), and various sweets like shekerbura (honey cookies). But the question specifically mentions the Lunar New Year. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe some communities in Azerbaijan have adopted Lunar New Year traditions, but that seems unlikely. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the Chinese New Year, and they think that Azerbaijan has a similar tradition. However, I don't recall any specific dishes from Azerbaijan associated with the Lunar New Year. It's possible that the answer is that they don't have a specific symbolic food for the Lunar New Year, as it's not a traditional holiday there. But the user might be expecting an answer related to Nowruz, which is a more relevant New Year-like celebration in Azerbaijan.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different cultural group within Azerbaijan. But I think the most accurate answer is that the Lunar New Year is not traditionally celebrated in Azerbaijan, so there isn't a specific symbolic food associated with it. However, if the user intended to ask about Nowruz, then the answer would be different. But since the question specifically says Lunar New Year, I should stick to that. Therefore, the answer might be that there is no traditional symbolic food",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""What religion is mainly taught in schools in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what religion is mainly taught in schools in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall the religious composition of Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan is a predominantly Muslim country, but I should verify if that's the case.

Azerbaijan is a secular state, right? So the constitution probably guarantees freedom of religion. But the main religion practiced there is Islam. However, the question is about what's taught in schools. In many countries, even if the majority religion is Islam, the education system might be secular. For example, in Turkey, while Islam is the main religion, schools are secular. But maybe in Azerbaijan, they have religious education as part of the curriculum?

Wait, I should check if there's a specific religious education in schools. I remember that in some Muslim countries, Islamic studies are part of the school curriculum. But in Azerbaijan, the government might promote secular education. However, the majority of the population is Muslim, so maybe they have some form of religious education, but not as the main focus. Alternatively, maybe the main religion taught is not a specific one, but the state is secular, so they might not teach any specific religion in schools.

Wait, but the question is asking what religion is mainly taught. If the schools are secular, they might not teach any specific religion. But maybe they have some general teachings about religion, or perhaps they focus on the national religion. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Azerbaijan's constitution says that the state is secular, meaning it doesn't favor any religion. However, the majority of citizens are Muslim, so maybe in schools, there's some mention of Islam, but not as a primary subject. Or perhaps the main religion taught is not a specific one, but the state doesn't promote any particular religion in schools.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that secularism is the main focus, and no specific religion is taught. But the user is asking for a religion, so maybe the answer is that no specific religion is mainly taught, but the main religion of the country is Islam. However, the question is about what is taught in schools, not the main religion of the country. So if the schools are secular, they might not teach any specific religion. But I need to confirm this.

I should look up whether Azerbaijan's schools teach religious education. From what I remember, in Azerbaijan, religious education is not part of the state curriculum. The government has been promoting secular education, and while there",1,,,,

{""question"":""What do people from Azerbaijan eat in Ramadan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people in Azerbaijan eat during Ramadan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. They have a lot of dishes influenced by their location between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus. Common ingredients include rice, lamb, and various herbs.

Ramadan is a time for fasting from dawn to sunset, so meals are usually eaten at iftar (the evening meal) and suhoor (the pre-dawn meal). I know that during Ramadan, people might have specific dishes for these times. For example, in many Muslim countries, dates are eaten at iftar to break the fast, but I'm not sure if that's common in Azerbaijan. 

Azerbaijani dishes include things like plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed grape leaves or vegetables), and kebabs. Maybe they have special versions of these during Ramadan. Also, they might prepare more sweets and desserts since it's a time for indulgence. Sweets like baklava, which is common in the region, could be part of their meals. 

I should check if there are any traditional dishes specific to Ramadan in Azerbaijan. Maybe dishes like ""pilaf"" (similar to plov) are eaten at iftar. Also, soups like ""shorba"" might be part of suhoor. Dishes with lentils or beans could be common as they are filling and nutritious for the fast. 

I should avoid assuming too much. For example, while dates are traditional in some countries, maybe Azerbaijan has other fruits or foods for breaking the fast. Also, considering the influence of Turkish and Persian cuisines, dishes like ""kufte"" (meatballs) or ""shashlik"" (grilled skewers) might be part of the meals. 

So putting it all together, the answer should list typical Azerbaijani dishes eaten during Ramadan, including both main courses and desserts, and maybe mention that dates are eaten at iftar, but I need to confirm if that's the case. Alternatively, they might have other fruits like figs or apricots. Also, dairy products like yogurt or kefir might be consumed, especially during suhoor for sustenance.

I think the main points are: iftar includes dishes like plov, dolma, kebabs, and desserts like baklava. Suhoor might have soups, eggs, and dairy. Also, fruits and nuts are commonly",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the duration of undergraduate education in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how long undergraduate education lasts in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about education systems in different countries. In many countries, undergraduate studies typically take around 3 to 4 years. For example, in the US, it's 4 years for a bachelor's degree, while in some European countries, it might be 3 years.

Now, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region. I remember that their education system has been influenced by both Soviet and Western models. During the Soviet era, higher education usually took 5 years for a bachelor's degree. However, after gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan might have reformed its education system to align more with European standards.

I should check if there have been any reforms. From what I've read, many former Soviet republics have transitioned to a 4-year undergraduate system, similar to the Bologna Process in Europe. The Bologna Process aims to standardize higher education across Europe, which includes a three-cycle system (Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate). So, if Azerbaijan is part of this, their undergraduate programs might be 3 or 4 years.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about specific universities in Azerbaijan. For instance, the Azerbaijan State University or the Oil and Gas University. If I can recall, some sources mention that bachelor's degrees in Azerbaijan are typically 4 years. However, some programs might take 5 years, especially in fields like medicine or engineering, which are longer in many countries.

But the question is about the general duration of undergraduate education. Maybe the standard is 4 years. However, I need to confirm whether the majority of undergraduate programs are 4 years or if it's 5. Another angle: the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan's official website or educational regulations. Since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

Alternatively, comparing with neighboring countries. In Turkey, undergraduate is 4 years. In Georgia, it's 4 years as well. Since Azerbaijan is part of the Bologna Process, it's likely that they have adopted a 4-year bachelor's degree. However, I've also heard that some programs might still be 5 years, but the standard bachelor's is 4 years.

So, considering all that, the answer is probably 4 years. But I need to be careful. Maybe I should check if there are exceptions. For example, some specialized programs might be longer",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, I need to figure out what people eat on their birthday in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling any information I have about Azerbaijani cuisine. I know that Azerbaijani food is influenced by Persian, Turkish, and Caucasian cuisines. Common dishes include things like plov, which is a rice dish with meat and vegetables, maybe similar to pilaf. There's also dolma, which are stuffed grape leaves or vegetables. Shish kebab might be popular too, as grilled meats are common in the region.

But wait, the question is specifically about birthday meals. I'm not sure if there are specific dishes reserved only for birthdays. Maybe they have traditional dishes that are eaten on special occasions. I remember hearing about sumalak, which is a sweet porridge made from wheat and honey, often prepared during Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Nowruz is a big celebration in Azerbaijan, but is it also associated with birthdays?

Alternatively, maybe people have a special cake or dessert for birthdays. In many cultures, cake is a common birthday food. However, I'm not certain if Azerbaijan has a specific type of cake. They might use local ingredients, like fruits or nuts, in their birthday cakes. Also, considering the influence from neighboring countries, maybe they have similar traditions to Turkey or Iran.

Wait, I should check if there's a specific dish. Let me think. Another possibility is that they might have a special soup or stew. For example, ghovlou is a traditional soup made with lamb and vegetables. But would that be specific to birthdays?

Alternatively, maybe it's more about the types of food they generally enjoy, not necessarily something unique to birthdays. So perhaps the answer includes common dishes like plov, dolma, kebab, and maybe a sweet like baklava or something similar. Also, considering the Nowruz connection, sumalak might be part of celebrations, but not sure about birthdays specifically.

Hmm, I think I need to focus on what's commonly eaten on birthdays. If there's no specific dish, then the answer would be the general traditional foods. But I might be missing something. Let me try to recall if there's a birthday cake tradition. I think in Azerbaijan, like in many places, people might eat a layered cake with cream and fruits. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, they might have a special type of bread or pastry.

Okay, I need to figure out what food items people in Azerbaijan typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine and drinking habits.

First, Azerbaijan is a country with a rich culinary tradition influenced by both Middle Eastern and Central Asian cuisines. They have a lot of dishes that are hearty and flavorful. Now, when it comes to pairing food with hard liquor, which in this context might refer to spirits like vodka, brandy, or other strong alcoholic drinks.

I remember that in many cultures, strong alcoholic drinks are paired with salty or savory foods to balance the flavors. For example, in Russia, people often eat pickled vegetables or salty snacks with vodka. Maybe Azerbaijan has similar traditions.

Azerbaijani cuisine includes dishes like kebabs, dolma (stuffed grape leaves), pilaf, and various types of meat dishes. There's also a lot of use of herbs and spices. Also, they have a tradition of drinking tea, but the question is about hard liquor.

Another angle: maybe they have specific appetizers or snacks that go with alcohol. I've heard of things like ""shashlik"" which is a type of skewered meat, similar to kebabs. Also, cheese is common in many regions. Maybe they have cheese plates or similar.

Wait, I should check if there are any specific Azerbaijani dishes that are commonly eaten with hard liquor. Maybe something like ""manti"" (dumplings), but I'm not sure if that's paired with alcohol. Alternatively, maybe they have certain types of nuts or dried fruits, which are common in the Caucasus region.

Another thought: in some cultures, they serve salty snacks like nuts, olives, or pickles with alcohol. Since Azerbaijan has a lot of agricultural products, perhaps they use local pickled vegetables or cheeses.

I should also consider that hard liquor might be consumed during social gatherings or celebrations, where more substantial foods are served. So, dishes like grilled meats, bread with various spreads, or cheese could be typical.

Putting this together, possible answers could include dishes like kebabs, cheese, pickled vegetables, or bread with spreads. But I need to make sure these are actually common pairings in Azerbaijan specifically.

Okay, so I need to figure out what type of clothing middle and high school students in Azerbaijan wear to school. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and education.

First, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their culture has influences from both Eastern and Western traditions. In many countries, school uniforms are common, but I'm not sure if Azerbaijan requires them. I remember that in some Muslim countries, there might be specific dress codes, like modest clothing for girls. But I should check if that's the case here.

I think in Azerbaijan, public schools might have a more relaxed dress code compared to some other countries. However, there could be some guidelines. For example, girls might be expected to wear skirts or dresses that are not too short, and boys might wear pants and shirts. But I'm not certain if there's an official uniform or if it's more casual.

Wait, I should consider that in some regions or private schools, uniforms might be enforced. But the question is about middle and high school students generally. Maybe the answer is that they wear casual clothing, but with some modesty requirements. For instance, avoiding revealing clothing, and perhaps specific colors or styles in certain schools.

Alternatively, maybe there's a standard uniform. Let me think. I recall that in some former Soviet countries, there were more structured uniforms, but Azerbaijan has moved towards more Western styles. However, I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is that there's no strict uniform, but students are expected to dress modestly, with girls wearing skirts or dresses and boys wearing pants and shirts, avoiding tight or revealing clothing.

I should also consider if there are any religious influences. Since Azerbaijan is predominantly Muslim, but secular, there might be some expectations for modesty. However, in practice, it might be more about general modesty rather than strict religious dress codes. So, the clothing would be casual but modest, with no specific uniform required unless in certain private or religious schools.

Putting this together, the answer would likely be that students wear casual, modest clothing. Girls might wear skirts or dresses, and boys wear pants and shirts, with no strict uniform policy in public schools. But I need to make sure that's accurate. Maybe check if there's any official information on school dress codes in Azerbaijan. Since I can't access external sources, I'll rely on general knowledge.

So the answer is that middle and high school students in Azerbaijan typically wear casual, modest clothing. Girls often wear skirts or dresses",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Where do the dependent elderly usually live in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out where dependent elderly people usually live in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's demographics and social structures. Azerbaijan is a country in the South Caucasus, and like many countries, it has a growing elderly population due to factors like lower birth rates and increased life expectancy.

First, I should consider the living arrangements for the elderly. In many cultures, including some in the Caucasus region, it's common for elderly family members to live with their children. This is often due to cultural values emphasizing family care and support. So maybe a significant portion of dependent elderly live with their families.

However, Azerbaijan has been undergoing urbanization, so there might be differences between urban and rural areas. In cities, there might be more institutional care options, like nursing homes or elderly care facilities. But I'm not sure how widespread these are. Also, economic factors could play a role. If families can't afford to care for their elderly, they might have to rely on state-run facilities.

Another angle is government policies. Does Azerbaijan have specific programs or infrastructure for elderly care? I know that in some countries, there are state-sponsored homes for the elderly, especially for those who are destitute or have no family to care for them. So perhaps some elderly live in these institutions.

Also, considering the term ""dependent elderly,"" this might refer to those who need assistance with daily activities. If they can't live independently, they might either live with family or in care homes. I should check if there's data on the prevalence of each option.

I should also think about potential sources of information. Maybe reports from the World Bank, UN agencies, or Azerbaijani government publications. But since I can't access external information, I have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I remember, in post-Soviet countries, including Azerbaijan, there's a mix of family-based care and some institutional care, but family care is more common, especially in rural areas where extended families are more prevalent.

So putting it together, the answer might be that dependent elderly in Azerbaijan usually live with their families, particularly in rural areas, while some may reside in state-run elderly care homes, especially in urban centers where family support might be less available or where the elderly have no family to care for them.

Wait, but the question asks for the usual living arrangement. So the primary answer would be family homes, with a secondary mention of institutional care. However, the user wants a single list answer. So the answer",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular indoor sport in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has a strong tradition in sports like wrestling, particularly Sambo, and they've had successful athletes in boxing and weightlifting. But those are usually outdoor or in stadiums, not specifically indoor.

Wait, indoor sports would be things like basketball, volleyball, badminton, table tennis, or maybe even sports like chess, which is played indoors. But which one is the most popular? I should check if there's any data on sports participation in Azerbaijan. I remember that football (soccer) is very popular in Azerbaijan, but that's played outdoors on a field, so it doesn't count here.

Looking at indoor sports, maybe basketball is a possibility. Azerbaijan has a national basketball team, and they might have leagues. But I'm not sure if it's the most popular. Alternatively, maybe chess? Azerbaijan has a strong chess presence; they've had grandmasters like Teimour Radjabov. However, chess is more of a cerebral sport, and while it's popular among enthusiasts, it might not be the most popular in terms of participation.

Another angle: when considering popularity, it's often about television viewership or the number of participants. If I can't find data, maybe looking at the sports that are most promoted by the government or have the most infrastructure. Azerbaijan has invested in sports facilities, but I'm not sure which indoor sport is prioritized.

Wait, I think I've heard that wrestling, specifically Sambo, is very popular in Azerbaijan. But Sambo is usually practiced in a gym, which is an indoor setting. However, is it considered an indoor sport? Maybe, but I'm not certain if it's the most popular. Alternatively, maybe volleyball? There's a volleyball league in Azerbaijan, but again, not sure about popularity compared to others.

Another thought: in many countries, basketball is a popular indoor sport. Azerbaijan might have a strong basketball culture. However, without specific data, it's hard to tell. Maybe the answer is chess, given the country's success in it. But I need to be cautious here. Let me try to recall if there's any official sources or surveys. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is wrestling, but I need to confirm if it's considered an indoor sport. Wrestling can be done indoors, but it's also often associated with outdoor competitions. Hmm. Maybe the most popular indoor sport is",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What are the most popular sweets in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the most popular sweets in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that they have a lot of dishes influenced by Persian and Turkish cuisines, so maybe their sweets are similar to those regions. 

First, I should think about traditional desserts from the region. There's something called ""shekerbura,"" which I think is a type of sweet pastry. Then there's ""baklava,"" which is common in many Middle Eastern and Balkan countries, so that might be popular there too. 

Another one that comes to mind is ""gazma,"" which I believe is a sweet made with nuts and syrup. Also, ""halva"" is a common sweet in many cultures, so maybe that's included. There's ""pilaf"" but that's more of a savory dish, so probably not. 

Wait, there's also ""shishbarma"" but that's more of a meat dish. Let me focus on sweets. Maybe ""muhallabiya,"" which is a type of pudding. Also, ""qurut"" is dried milk product, but is that considered a sweet? Maybe not. 

I should check if there are specific sweets unique to Azerbaijan. ""Shirin paxlava"" might be another name for baklava. Then there's ""gozleme,"" but that's more like a savory pastry. 

Wait, ""sahlab"" is a dessert made from orchid roots, milk, and sugar. That might be popular. Also, ""tavuk göğsü"" is a milk-based dessert, but I'm not sure if it's common in Azerbaijan. 

Another possibility is ""qurabiya,"" which are cookies. Maybe ""sütaş"" is a type of candy. I think ""shekerbura"" and ""gazma"" are definitely traditional. Also, ""halva"" and ""baklava"" are staples. 

I should make a list of these and see which ones are most commonly mentioned. Let me try to recall or think of any other names. ""Paklava"" is another spelling of baklava. ""Gazma"" is definitely a sweet. ""Shekerbura"" is a sweet roll. ""Muhallabiya"" is a pudding. ""Sahlab"" is a dessert. 

I think the top ones would be shekerbura, baklava",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about coffee culture there. Azerbaijan has a growing café scene, influenced by both local and international chains.

First, I should consider major international brands that might have a presence in Azerbaijan. Starbucks is a global chain and likely has locations there. Then there's Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, which is also popular in various countries. However, I'm not sure if they are the most popular in Azerbaijan specifically.

Another angle is local or regional chains. Sometimes, local brands can be more popular because they cater better to local tastes. For example, there's a chain called ""Café 1919"" which is part of the Azeri company and might be well-known. Also, ""Rustavi Coffee"" is another local brand that's been around for a while. But I need to check if these are actually the most popular.

I should also think about recent trends. Maybe there's a newer chain that's gaining traction. However, without current data, it's hard to say. Another approach is to look at online reviews or social media presence. If I remember correctly, Starbucks has a significant number of outlets in Baku, the capital, which might indicate popularity.

Wait, but maybe there's a local chain that's more dominant. I think ""Café 1919"" is part of the ""1919"" group, which also owns a supermarket chain. They might have a strong presence. However, I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is ""Nestlé"" with their local brands, but they might not be a café chain.

Alternatively, maybe ""Café L'Atelier"" or other European chains have a foothold there. But again, without specific data, it's challenging. The safest bet might be Starbucks, given their global reach and presence in many countries, including Azerbaijan. However, I need to confirm if there's a more dominant local brand.

After considering all these factors, I think the most popular might be a local chain like ""Café 1919"" or ""Rustavi Coffee,"" but I'm not 100% sure. However, based on available information and the presence of international chains, Starbucks could be the most popular. But I need to verify this. Wait, a quick search in my mind: Azerbaijan has several Starbucks locations, but local chains might be more prevalent. Hmm",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which job is considered underpaid in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which job is considered underpaid in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall the economic situation in Azerbaijan. The country's economy is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports. That might mean that certain sectors are more developed than others. Jobs in the energy sector might be well-paid because of the high demand and the nature of the industry. But what about other sectors?

I remember reading that in many countries, public sector jobs or certain service industries might be underpaid. In Azerbaijan, maybe teaching or healthcare? Wait, but in some places, government jobs can be stable but not high-paying. However, I should be careful here. Are there specific reports or data on underpaid jobs in Azerbaijan?

Another angle: the minimum wage in Azerbaijan. If the minimum wage is low, then jobs that pay around that might be considered underpaid. For example, jobs in retail, hospitality, or manual labor positions. But the user is asking for a specific job title.

Wait, I think I've heard that in Azerbaijan, jobs like teachers, especially in rural areas, or public sector employees might not be well-paid. Alternatively, maybe positions in the informal sector. But I need to be precise.

Wait, there's a report from the International Labour Organization or other organizations that might highlight underpaid sectors. Alternatively, local news sources might discuss this. For example, in 2020, there was some discussion about low wages in the public sector and certain professions. However, without specific data, it's hard to be certain.

Alternatively, think about the structure of the economy. Since the economy is oil-dependent, maybe other sectors like agriculture or small businesses are underpaid. But again, not sure.

Wait, I think the most common answer in similar contexts is that teaching is considered underpaid. In many countries, teachers are underpaid relative to their workload and importance. Maybe in Azerbaijan as well. But I need to check if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe jobs in the civil service or government positions. However, in some countries, government jobs can be well-paid but have limited opportunities. But again, not sure.

Wait, I should look for any specific information. For example, a quick search in my memory: Azerbaijan's minimum wage is around 100 AZN per month (as of recent years). That's quite low. So jobs that pay this amount might be considered underpaid. What are the common jobs that pay this? Maybe retail,",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What type of clubs are most popular among university students in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what types of clubs are most popular among university students in Azerbaijan. Let me start by considering the cultural and social context of Azerbaijan. The country has a mix of traditional and modern influences, so clubs might reflect that.

First, I know that in many countries, cultural and academic clubs are popular. Maybe in Azerbaijan, there are clubs related to traditional arts, music, or dance. Also, considering the youth, social and recreational clubs like sports teams or gaming might be common. 

I should also think about the educational environment. Universities often have academic clubs, like debate teams, science societies, or language clubs. But I'm not sure if those are the most popular in Azerbaijan specifically. 

Another angle is the influence of neighboring countries. For example, in some Central Asian countries, Islamic or religious clubs might be prevalent, but I'm not certain about Azerbaijan. However, Azerbaijan is a secular country with a significant Muslim population, so maybe there's a mix.

Also, considering the younger generation's interests, technology and programming clubs might be growing in popularity, especially with the rise of IT industries. But again, I need to verify if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

Wait, I remember that Azerbaijan has a strong tradition in music, particularly in genres like mugham. So maybe music-related clubs are popular. Also, sports like football (soccer) are widely loved there, so sports clubs might be common.

Additionally, there might be clubs focused on national identity, such as those promoting Azerbaijani language, literature, or history. Language exchange clubs could also be popular, especially with the increasing interest in learning foreign languages like English, Russian, or Turkish.

But I need to prioritize. Which of these are most likely? Sports clubs, cultural clubs, academic clubs, or maybe social clubs like film or art. Since the question asks for the most popular, I should consider which have the broadest appeal. Sports and cultural clubs often have wide participation. Also, maybe clubs related to technology and innovation are rising due to global trends.

However, without specific data, I have to make an educated guess based on common trends. In many countries, sports, cultural, and academic clubs are top. So combining that with Azerbaijan's context, the answer might include sports, cultural, and academic clubs. But to give a single list, perhaps the most prominent ones are sports clubs, cultural clubs, and language/academic clubs. Maybe also youth organizations or volunteer groups. But I need to ensure that the answer is accurate",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which food is a cost-effective and quick meal option in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which food in Azerbaijan is both cost-effective and quick to make. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. They have a lot of dishes that use staples like rice, potatoes, and eggs. Plov is a common dish, but it might take longer to cook since it's rice-based with meat and vegetables. Then there's dolma, which is stuffed grape leaves or vegetables, but that might require more preparation time.

Wait, there's also a dish called ""pilaf,"" which is similar to plov but maybe quicker? Or maybe not. Another thought: in many countries, dishes like omelettes or fried eggs with bread are quick and cheap. In Azerbaijan, maybe they have something similar. Oh, ""menemen"" is a Turkish dish, but Azerbaijan has its own version. It's like a scrambled egg dish with tomatoes and peppers. That could be quick and use inexpensive ingredients.

Also, ""shish kebab"" is popular, but it might be more expensive and require grilling. Then there's ""ghovlou,"" which is a type of stuffed bread, but again, not sure about the cost. Maybe ""khinkali,"" which are dumplings, but those might take time to prepare. 

Wait, ""plov"" is a staple, but it's more of a main dish. However, maybe ""shashlik"" is quicker? No, shashlik is grilled meat, which takes time to prepare. 

Another angle: street food. In many places, street food is both quick and cheap. In Azerbaijan, ""lavash"" is a type of flatbread, but that's just bread. Maybe ""dolma"" is a street food option, but again, preparation time. 

Wait, ""menemen"" is made with eggs, tomatoes, and peppers, which are all affordable and can be cooked quickly. It's similar to a shakshuka. That might be a good candidate. Also, ""choban kebabi"" is a meat dish, but again, not sure about the speed. 

Alternatively, ""qutab"" is a type of pancake, but that's more of a snack. Maybe ""kufte"" (meatballs), but again, cooking time. 

I think the most likely answer is ""menemen"" because it's a simple dish with basic ingredients that can be cooked quickly. Alternatively, ""plov"" is common but might not",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""What are the family-related holidays in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the family-related holidays in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani holidays. First, there's the New Year, which is celebrated on December 31st and January 1st. That's a big family event where people gather with relatives.

Then there's the Nowruz holiday, which is a traditional Persian New Year. It's celebrated on the spring equinox, usually around March 20th or 21st. Families come together for feasts and rituals, so that's definitely family-related.

Another one is the Victory Day, which commemorates the end of World War II on May 9th. While it's a national holiday, families might gather to honor the past and spend time together.

There's also the Independence Day on October 18th, celebrating Azerbaijan's independence from the Soviet Union. Again, this is a national holiday where families might have gatherings.

Wait, are there any other holidays specifically focused on family? Maybe the Day of the Family? I'm not sure if Azerbaijan has that. Let me check. Hmm, I don't recall a specific ""Day of the Family"" being a public holiday there. The main ones seem to be the ones I listed: New Year, Nowruz, Victory Day, and Independence Day. Maybe also the Kurban Bayram, which is the Islamic holiday of sacrifice, but that's more religious than family-specific. However, families do gather for that as well. But since the question is about family-related, maybe including Kurban Bayram as well. But I need to confirm if it's a public holiday in Azerbaijan. Yes, Kurban Bayram is a public holiday, usually in December. So that's another family-oriented holiday.

Wait, but the user asked for family-related, so maybe include those. Let me make sure. New Year, Nowruz, Victory Day, Independence Day, Kurban Bayram. Are there others? Maybe the Republic Day on May 28th? That's a national holiday, but not sure if it's family-focused. Probably not as much as the others.

So compiling the list: New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, Nowruz, Victory Day, Independence Day, Kurban Bayram. Let me check the dates again. New Year is December 31 and January 1. Nowruz is March 21. Victory Day May 9, Independence Day October 18, Kurban Bayram in December.",1,,,,

Okay, I need to figure out the popular snacks in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that they have a lot of dishes influenced by Persian and Turkish cuisines, given their geographical location. 

First, I think of their traditional dishes. There's plov, which is a rice dish, but that's more of a main meal. Then there are various meze or appetizers. Maybe things like dolma? Wait, dolma is stuffed grape leaves, but I think in Azerbaijan they might use different vegetables. Oh right, they have ""dolma"" made from vine leaves, eggplants, or peppers. That's probably a snack or appetizer.

Another thing is ""sığır çorbası"" which is beef soup, but that's a soup. Maybe not a snack. Then there's ""ghovlou"" which is a type of bread, but again, more of a staple. 

Wait, I think they have some specific snacks. For example, ""manti"" are dumplings, but they're usually served with yogurt and garlic. Maybe they're considered a snack. Then there's ""pilaf"" which is similar to plov, but again, a main dish. 

Oh, there's ""shish kebab"" but that's more of a main course. What about ""baklava""? That's a sweet, but maybe not a typical snack. Maybe ""chips"" or ""kufte"" which are meatballs? Or ""tavuk göğsü"" which is a milk-based dessert, but again, not a snack. 

Wait, I should check if there are specific snacks like ""gözleme"" which is a stuffed flatbread. That's often eaten as a snack or street food. Also, ""simit"" which is a ring-shaped bread, similar to Turkish simit. 

Another thing is ""qara qız"" which is a type of sweet, but maybe not a snack. Then there's ""honey"" and ""candied fruits"" as snacks. Also, ""cheese"" like ""tulum"" cheese, which is a type of brined cheese.

{""question"":""Who is the most popular soccer coach in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out who the most popular soccer coach in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling any prominent coaches from there. I know that Azerbaijan has had some notable coaches in both domestic and international football.

First, I remember that Heydarov brothers, like Rovshan and Elmar, have been involved in coaching. Rovshan Heydarov was the head coach of the Azerbaijani national team at some point. Also, there's a coach named Safaraliyev, maybe Rashad? I think he's had a long career and might be well-respected.

Wait, but popularity can be subjective. Maybe I should check recent information. If I can't access current data, I have to rely on known names. Another name that comes to mind is Samir Abbasov, but I'm not sure if he's a coach or a player. Let me think again.

Rovshan Heydarov was the manager of the national team, so he might be popular. Also, there's a coach named Eldar Necefli, but I'm not certain about his popularity. Maybe I should focus on the national team coaches since they are more visible.

Another angle: looking at clubs in Azerbaijan. The top clubs like Qarabag FK have had coaches like Hakan Şükür, but he's Turkish. Or maybe someone like Fuad Mamedov, who has coached Qarabag. However, I'm not sure about his popularity compared to others.

Wait, there's a coach named Eynulla Guliyev who has been associated with the national team. But I think the most prominent name is Rovshan Heydarov, as he's been in charge of the national team and has a significant presence in Azerbaijani football. However, I should verify if there are any other coaches who might be more popular, perhaps due to recent successes or longer tenure.

Alternatively, maybe a foreign coach who's had success in Azerbaijan's top league. For example, someone like Albert Bunjaku, but he's from Kosovo. Or maybe someone like Andrey Tikhonov, but again, not sure.

Considering all this, Rovshan Heydarov seems like the most likely answer, but I need to be cautious. If there's a more recent or more popular coach, I might be missing that. However, based on available knowledge up to 2023, Rovshan Heydarov is a prominent figure. Alternatively, maybe Rashad Safar",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""What is the most popular winter sport in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular winter sport in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The climate there is mostly temperate, but I'm not sure about the winter sports scene.

First, I should consider the common winter sports. Skiing, ice hockey, figure skating, maybe snowboarding. But Azerbaijan isn't known for having a lot of snow-covered areas. Wait, they have some mountains, like the Greater Caucasus range. Maybe there are ski resorts there. I remember hearing about a ski resort called ""Shusha"" or something similar. Wait, Shusha is a city in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a disputed region. Not sure if that's still operational.

Alternatively, maybe ice sports are more popular. Ice hockey is a common winter sport in countries with colder climates. But does Azerbaijan have a strong ice hockey presence? I'm not sure. Also, maybe curling? I think Azerbaijan has participated in some international curling events. But is it popular?

Another angle: looking at the population's interests. Azerbaijan's population is around 10 million. They have a rich cultural heritage, but winter sports might not be as prominent as in Nordic countries. However, the government might invest in certain sports for international competitions. For example, I remember that Azerbaijan has had some success in sports like weightlifting, wrestling, and maybe even ice sports.

Wait, there's a sport called ""freestyle skiing"" or ""snowboarding"" but again, without proper snow, it's hard to have those. Maybe ice sports are more feasible. Let me check if there are ice rinks in Baku, the capital. I think there are some ice rinks, and ice hockey teams. Maybe the most popular is ice hockey, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a traditional winter sport but something else. Wait, maybe it's not a winter sport at all. But the question specifically asks for a winter sport. Another thought: Azerbaijan might not have a very popular winter sport due to the lack of snow, so maybe they focus on other sports. However, the question says ""most popular winter sport,"" implying there is one.

Wait, I found some information in the past that Azerbaijan has a national ice hockey team. Also, there's a sport called ""ice hockey"" which is played on ice. Maybe that",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular children's song in Azerbaijan that families sing together?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most popular children's song in Azerbaijan that families sing together. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall if there are any well-known Azerbaijani children's songs. I know that in many countries, there are traditional lullabies or folk songs passed down through generations. Azerbaijan has a rich musical heritage, so maybe there's a traditional song that's commonly sung by families.

I remember that ""Şərqin Qızı"" (The Girl from the East) is a popular song, but I'm not sure if it's specifically for children. Another possibility is ""Yaşlı Adam"" (The Old Man), but again, not sure about its target audience. Wait, maybe ""Mən Çocuqam"" (I Am a Child) is a children's song. But I need to verify if it's the most popular one.

Alternatively, there might be a traditional lullaby like ""Mənə Uyux"" (Sleep, My Child) that's commonly used. However, I should check if there's a specific song that's widely recognized as the most popular. Since I don't have access to current data, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. 

Another angle: sometimes children's songs are based on folk tales or have simple, repetitive lyrics that are easy for children to learn. Maybe ""Qara Dağ"" (Black Mountain) is a traditional song, but again, not certain. 

Wait, I think ""Şərqin Qızı"" might be more of a general folk song rather than specifically for children. Perhaps ""Yaşıl Alman"" (Green Alman) is a children's song, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest answer might be that there isn't a single officially recognized most popular song, but a commonly sung one could be ""Mən Çocuqam."" However, I need to be cautious here. If I'm not certain, maybe the answer is that there's no single most popular one, but the user is expecting a specific song. 

Alternatively, maybe ""Dünya Qara Olur"" (The World Becomes Black) is a children's song, but again, not sure. I think I need to go with the best possible answer based on available knowledge, even if it's not 100% certain. So, I'll suggest ""Mən Çocuqam"" as",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking about a food that children in Azerbaijan typically dislike but the elderly enjoy. Hmm, I need to think about traditional Azerbaijani dishes and which ones might be considered less appealing to kids but more so for older people.

First, I know that Azerbaijani cuisine includes dishes like plov, dolma, kebabs, and various types of soups. But which of these might be disliked by children? Maybe something with strong flavors or certain ingredients that are more common in older generations' diets.

Wait, there's a dish called ""tovuq göbələk"" which is chicken with mushrooms. Not sure if that's it. Or maybe ""dolma"" which is stuffed grape leaves or vegetables. But I think dolma is generally liked by all ages. 

Another possibility is ""kərə"" which is a type of soup made with meat and vegetables, sometimes with a sour taste. Maybe the sourness is something children don't like. Or ""şirni"" which is a type of sweet, but that's more for kids. 

Wait, there's a dish called ""qovurma"" which is a type of meat dish cooked with onions and tomatoes. Maybe that's too strong for children. Alternatively, ""pilaf"" is a staple, but again, not sure about the dislike aspect.

Oh, I remember that in some cultures, certain fermented foods are more popular among the elderly. Maybe ""kərə"" or ""pilaf"" with specific ingredients. Wait, another thought: ""tərəvə"" is a type of fermented cheese, but I don't think that's common. 

Wait, maybe ""laz bulgur"" which is a type of porridge made from cracked wheat. It's a traditional dish, but perhaps the texture or taste is not preferred by children. Alternatively, ""məmməd"" which is a type of bread, but that's more of a staple.

Alternatively, ""qutlumal"" which is a kind of dessert, but that's sweet and probably liked by kids. 

Wait, I think I've heard that ""qara qəlyan"" (black qəlyan) is a type of dish, but not sure. Alternatively, ""qurut"" which is dried yogurt, but again, not sure about the age preference.

Wait, maybe ""tovuq qazan"" (chicken",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Where do high school students in Azerbaijan usually go after dinner?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out where high school students in Azerbaijan usually go after dinner. Let me start by thinking about the typical daily routines of students in different countries. In many places, after dinner, students might have some free time. But what's specific to Azerbaijan?

First, I should consider the cultural aspects. Azerbaijan is a country with a mix of traditions and modern influences. High school students there might have certain habits influenced by their family routines, school schedules, and social activities.

In some countries, students might go out with friends, maybe to hang out in parks, cafes, or go to the mall. But I need to check if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Also, considering the time after dinner, which is usually around 7-8 PM. Are there any common activities during that time?

Another angle: maybe they have homework or study sessions. But the question is about where they go, not what they do. So if they study, maybe they go to a study group at a friend's house or a library. However, I'm not sure if that's the most common.

Alternatively, family time could be important. Maybe they stay home, help with household chores, or spend time with family. But the question is about ""go,"" implying leaving home.

I should also think about social spots. Are there common hangout places for students? Maybe internet cafes, since internet access might be a factor. Or maybe they go to a local café or restaurant with friends.

Wait, I remember that in some countries, especially in the Caucasus region, family dinners are important, and after that, students might have some free time. But without specific knowledge, I need to make an educated guess.

Another thought: in Azerbaijan, after dinner, students might go to a park or a public place to relax. Or maybe they attend some extracurricular activities if they have any. However, high school students might not have structured activities after dinner unless it's part of their school program.

Alternatively, considering the time, they might watch TV or use their phones at home. But again, the question is about where they go, not what they do. So if they go out, it's a place, not an activity.

I think the most probable answer is that they go to public places like parks, cafes, or maybe meet friends at home. But I need to be specific. Since I don't have exact data, I might have to go with a common answer that fits the cultural context. Maybe they",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What food is associated with Halloween in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the food associated with Halloween in Azerbaijan. First, I need to recall if Halloween is celebrated in Azerbaijan. Halloween is more common in Western countries, but I know that some traditions might have been adopted or there might be local customs.

Azerbaijan has its own festivals and traditions. For example, they have Nowruz, which is a spring festival, but Halloween is in October. Maybe there's a local dish that's eaten around that time? Or perhaps a traditional food that's associated with the autumn season, which is when Halloween occurs.

I should check if there are any specific foods linked to Halloween in Azerbaijani culture. I know that in some countries, people eat pumpkin pies or candy apples for Halloween. But in Azerbaijan, the cuisine is different. They have dishes like plov, kebabs, dolma, etc. However, those are more general dishes and not specifically tied to Halloween.

Wait, maybe there's a local version of a Halloween treat. Alternatively, perhaps there's no specific food associated with Halloween in Azerbaijan, as the holiday might not be widely observed there. If that's the case, the answer might be that there isn't a specific food associated with Halloween in Azerbaijan, or maybe they use some traditional autumn foods.

But the user is asking for a food associated with Halloween. If Halloween isn't traditionally celebrated there, maybe there's a dish that's eaten during similar festivals. For example, during the autumn harvest, they might have certain foods. Or maybe they have a tradition of eating something on the night of October 31st, but I'm not sure.

I should verify if there are any sources or references. However, since I can't browse the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I don't recall any specific Azerbaijani food being linked to Halloween. Therefore, it's possible that there's no particular food associated with Halloween in Azerbaijan, or it might be that they don't observe Halloween, so there's no specific dish linked to it.

Alternatively, maybe they have a similar tradition of giving out sweets or eating something like ""gazma"" (a sweet made from nuts and honey), but that's a stretch. Without specific information, the safest answer would be that there isn't a specific food associated with Halloween in Azerbaijan, as the holiday is not widely observed there. However, the user might be expecting a different answer, so I need to make sure.

Another angle: Maybe the question is a trick,",1,,,,
