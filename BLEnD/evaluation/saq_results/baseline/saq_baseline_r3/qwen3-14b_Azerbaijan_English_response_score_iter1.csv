{""question"":""Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Azerbaijan's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Azerbaijan's society. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some places, turning 18 is a big deal because it's the age of majority. But in Azerbaijan, maybe there's something different. I should check if there are any traditional milestones.

Wait, I remember that in some countries, like in parts of the Middle East, the 13th birthday is significant for girls, but that's more related to the hijab. However, Azerbaijan is a secular country, so maybe that's not it. Alternatively, there's the concept of ""kurban"" or ""ramadan,"" but those are religious events, not birthdays.

Another angle: Maybe it's the 18th birthday because that's when you become an adult. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Or perhaps it's the 21st birthday, which is common in some Western cultures. However, I need to find specific information about Azerbaijan.

Wait, I recall that in Azerbaijan, there's a tradition called ""meydan"" or ""meydan gecesi"" which is a celebration for the 13th birthday, especially for girls. But I'm not certain if that's widely practiced or if it's more of a regional tradition. Alternatively, there might be no specific age that's more celebrated than others, but the question suggests there is one.

Alternatively, maybe it's the 18th birthday because that's when you become legally an adult. However, I need to verify this. If I can't find specific information, perhaps the answer is that there isn't a specific age, but the question implies there is. Maybe the answer is 18, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 21, but I need to be careful here.

Wait, another thought: In some cultures, the 50th birthday is a big deal, but that's more common in Western countries. In Azerbaijan, maybe the 21st is the age of majority, but I'm not sure. Let me check some sources in my mind. I think in Azerbaijan, the age of majority is 18, so that might be a key point. Therefore, the 18th birthday might be celebrated more grandly as a coming-of-age event. However,",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, so the user is asking about the average time people in Azerbaijan spend having dinner at a restaurant, and they want the answer in hours with one decimal place. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find data on dining durations in Azerbaijan. I know that dining times can vary by culture. For example, in some countries, dinner might be a quick affair, while in others, it's more leisurely. But I don't have specific data on Azerbaijan. Let me recall if there are any studies or reports about this.

Alternatively, maybe there are general trends. In many Western countries, a restaurant meal might take around 1.5 to 2 hours, including time for courses, conversation, and possibly drinks. However, in some Middle Eastern or Central Asian countries, meals might be longer, especially if they involve multiple courses or socializing.

Wait, but Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of cultures. Their dining habits might be influenced by both Eastern and Western practices. However, without specific data, it's hard to be precise. The user wants an average, but if I can't find exact numbers, maybe I need to make an educated guess based on similar regions.

Another angle: maybe looking at restaurant service times. If a typical meal includes an appetizer, main course, dessert, and drinks, that might take around 1.5 to 2 hours. But again, this is speculative.

I should also consider that the question might be expecting a standard answer, perhaps from a survey or a source like the World Bank or a cultural study. But I don't have access to that data right now. Since the user is expecting a numerical answer, maybe I should go with a commonly cited average for similar regions. For example, if in Turkey or Iran, dinner might take around 1.5 to 2 hours, then Azerbaijan might be similar. 

Alternatively, if it's a quick meal, maybe 1 hour. But I think the average is more likely around 1.5 to 2 hours. Given that the user wants one decimal place, perhaps 1.5 or 2.0. But which one?

Wait, maybe there's a source. Let me check my memory. I recall that in some studies, the average dining time in restaurants in various countries ranges from 1 to 2.5 hours. For example, in the US, it's about 1.5 hours. In some European countries, it can",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is about which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Azerbaijan. I need to figure this out.

First, I should think about the common trends in studying abroad. Many students from various countries tend to go for fields that are in demand in their home country or offer better career prospects. For Azerbaijan, maybe they look towards engineering, medicine, business, or IT?

I remember that Azerbaijan has a strong focus on oil and gas, so maybe engineering, particularly petroleum engineering? Or perhaps they go for medicine because healthcare is a stable field. Also, business and economics might be popular since they can work in international markets.

Wait, I've heard that many Azerbaijani students go to countries like Russia, Turkey, or European nations. In Russia, for example, engineering and IT are common. But maybe medicine is also a big one. Alternatively, maybe they pursue degrees in management or finance.

Another angle: some countries have specific programs or easier admission processes. For instance, medical schools in some countries might accept international students more readily. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Looking up some data in my mind... I think that in recent years, the most common fields for Azerbaijani students studying abroad include engineering, particularly mechanical or civil engineering, and also business administration. However, I've also heard that medicine is a popular choice. But which one is the most common?

Wait, there's a report I remember that said engineering is the top choice, especially in countries like Germany or the UK. But maybe I should check if there's a more recent trend. Alternatively, IT and computer science might be rising in popularity due to the tech boom.

Hmm. But the question is about the most common. I think the answer is likely engineering, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe economics or business. Wait, I've also heard that many go for law or international relations, but that might be less common.

Alternatively, considering the education system, maybe they go for bachelor's degrees in engineering. Let me try to recall any specific statistics. For example, in 2022, the largest number of Azerbaijani students abroad were studying engineering, followed by medicine and business. So maybe the answer is engineering.

But I need to be precise. The user wants the most common profession. If I can't be certain, but based on general knowledge, I think engineering is the most common, perhaps mechanical or civil. However, the answer might",1,,,1,1.0

Where do families gather to pray together in Azerbaijan?Provide one single answer as a list form at the end in a JSON format as below. Only the answer should be given with the list, without any examples.

{""question"":""Where do families gather to pray together in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The question is asking where families in Azerbaijan gather to pray together. First, I need to think about the religious practices in Azerbaijan. The main religion there is Islam, right? So, Muslims typically pray in mosques. But the question is specifically about families gathering. In many Muslim countries, families might pray together at home, especially for daily prayers like Fajr or Maghrib. However, for more significant prayers or gatherings, they might go to a mosque.

Wait, but the question is about where they gather. So maybe it's both home and mosques? But the answer needs to be a single list. Let me check. In Azerbaijan, there are mosques, and during certain times, families might attend prayers there. However, for daily prayers, it's common for families to pray at home. But maybe the primary place for communal prayer is the mosque. However, the question is about families gathering to pray together, which could be at home as well. But I'm not sure if there are specific places designated for family gatherings for prayer beyond the home or the mosque.

Alternatively, maybe there are specific community centers or places. But I think the most straightforward answer would be mosques, since that's where communal prayers happen. However, if families are praying together at home, then home would be the answer. But I need to confirm. Let me think again. In many Islamic cultures, families do pray together at home, especially for the five daily prayers. However, for larger congregational prayers like Jummah (Friday prayer), they go to the mosque. But the question is about where families gather to pray together, which could be either home or mosque. But maybe the answer expects the mosque as the primary place for communal prayers. However, the question doesn't specify the type of prayer. Hmm.

Wait, the answer needs to be in a list. So maybe the answer is both home and mosques? But I need to check if there's a primary answer. Let me think about the structure of the answer. If the user is looking for the most common places, then mosques for communal prayers and homes for daily family prayers. But the question is phrased as ""gather to pray together,"" which might imply a communal setting, so mosques. However, in some contexts, families might gather at home. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check some sources. Oh, but since I can't access external information, I have to rely on general knowledge. In many Muslim countries, families do",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most preferred recreational facility among children in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most preferred recreational facility among children in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's culture and available facilities. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and like many countries, children have various places to play and have fun.

First, I should consider common recreational facilities. Parks are usually popular because they offer open spaces for playing, sports, and outdoor activities. Then there are playgrounds with swings, slides, and other equipment. Maybe sports facilities like stadiums or sports centers? Also, zoos, amusement parks, or maybe even places like beaches if they have them.

But the question is about the most preferred one. I need to think about what's more accessible or commonly used by children. In many countries, playgrounds are a primary spot for kids. However, in some places, parks might be more preferred because they offer more space. Also, considering Azerbaijan's climate, maybe outdoor facilities are more common. But I'm not sure if there's a specific facility that's more popular there.

I should check if there are any notable parks or recreational areas in Azerbaijan. For example, the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku is a cultural venue, but that's more for adults. There's also the Maiden Tower and other historical sites, but those might not be recreational for children. Maybe the Baku Boulevard or other public parks?

Alternatively, maybe indoor recreational facilities like arcades or game centers. But I think outdoor spaces are more common for children. Also, considering the country's development, maybe modern playgrounds with equipment are preferred. However, without specific data, it's hard to be certain. But based on general trends, playgrounds or parks are often top choices for children's recreation. 

Another angle: some countries have a strong emphasis on sports. If Azerbaijan promotes certain sports, maybe facilities related to that. But I don't recall specific info on that. 

Given the lack of specific data, the safest answer based on commonality would be playgrounds or parks. Since the question asks for the most preferred, and playgrounds are specifically designed for children's play, I think playgrounds might be the answer. However, sometimes parks are considered as recreational facilities too. But the answer might be playgrounds. Alternatively, maybe public parks with playground areas. 

Wait, the question says ""recreational facility,"" which can be a bit broad. But in many contexts, playgrounds are a type of recreational facility. So I'll go with playgrounds",1,,,1,0.3333333333333333

{""question"":""What do people from Azerbaijan eat in Eid ul Fitr?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what people in Azerbaijan eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me start by recalling what Eid ul Fitr is. It's the Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. So, during this time, there are special foods that are traditionally eaten.

Now, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their cuisine is influenced by both Middle Eastern and Central Asian flavors. I know that in many Muslim countries, dishes like sweets, pastries, and specific celebratory foods are common during Eid. For example, in some places, they might have dishes like baklava or other types of sweets.

I should check if there are any specific dishes unique to Azerbaijan for this occasion. Maybe something like ""pilaf"" which is a rice dish common in many Central Asian countries. Also, there's a dish called ""saryogly"" which is a type of stuffed vegetable, but I'm not sure if that's specifically for Eid. Another possibility is ""dolma,"" which are stuffed grape leaves or other vegetables, but again, not sure about the timing.

Wait, I remember that during Eid, there's a tradition of eating certain desserts. Maybe ""shekerbura,"" which are sweet pastries filled with nuts and raisins. That sounds familiar. Also, ""shirin pilaf"" which is a sweet rice dish, sometimes with fruits like apricots or raisins. Another possibility is ""kuzbari,"" which is a type of sweet and sour soup, but I'm not certain if that's eaten during Eid specifically.

I should also consider that in Azerbaijan, as in many countries, the main meal might include meat, like lamb or chicken, cooked in a special way. Maybe ""khash"" is a traditional dish, but that's more of a winter soup. Probably not for Eid.

Wait, I think ""shekerbura"" is definitely a candidate. Also, ""gogal"" which is a type of sweet bread. Another thing is ""muhum"" or ""muhum"" which is a type of sweet roll. There's also ""qurabiya,"" which are shortcrust pastries filled with nuts and raisins, similar to Turkish lokum but different.

Putting this together, the main foods during Eid ul Fitr in Azerbaijan would likely include various sweets and pastries like shekerbura, qurabiya, and maybe some types of pilaf. I",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and sports.

First, Azerbaijan is a country with a rich cultural heritage, and family activities are important. Traditional sports might be part of their culture. I remember that wrestling is a traditional sport there, maybe something like Varzesh-e Pahlavani, which is a form of martial arts. That could be something families do together.

Then there's football (soccer), which is popular worldwide, and Azerbaijan has a national team. Maybe families play football together. Also, maybe other sports like volleyball or basketball, but I'm not sure if those are as common for family activities.

Another possibility is traditional games. For example, ""Kok-Boru"" is a traditional sport in Azerbaijan, similar to polo. But is that played by families or more of a community event? Maybe not as common for parents and kids to play together regularly.

What about outdoor activities? Maybe things like hiking or cycling, but those might be more individual or with friends. Then there's chess, which is a strategic game. Azerbaijan has produced some strong chess players, so maybe families play chess together.

I should also consider if there are any sports that are specifically promoted for family participation. Maybe something like table tennis or badminton, which are easier to play at home. Also, maybe traditional dances, but that's more of a performance than a sport.

Wait, the question specifies sports, so physical activities. Let me check if there are any other traditional sports. Maybe ""Gylym"" (a game involving a stick and a ball), but I'm not sure about its popularity. Alternatively, ""Koprag"" is a sport that involves hitting a ball with a stick, but again, not sure about family participation.

Considering modern sports, maybe swimming or gymnastics, but those might require equipment or facilities. Football is the most likely, followed by wrestling. Also, maybe team sports like volleyball. But I need to make sure these are commonly played together by families.

Another angle: looking at the answer structure, it needs to be a list in JSON. The user wants only the answer, no examples. So I need to list the sports that are commonly played by parents and children together. Based on my knowledge, the most probable ones are football (soccer), wrestling, and maybe chess.

{""question"":""What are the required subjects in Azerbaijan's university entrance exam?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the required subjects for Azerbaijan's university entrance exam. First, I need to recall what I know about the education system in Azerbaijan. I remember that they have a centralized exam system, similar to other countries. The entrance exams are usually for high school graduates aiming to get into universities.

Now, the main subjects. In many countries, the entrance exams include subjects like mathematics, Azerbaijani language, and sometimes a foreign language. But I should verify if that's the case here. Also, depending on the university and the specific program, there might be additional subjects. For example, if someone is applying to a medical school, they might need biology or chemistry. But the question is about the required subjects in general, not specific to a program.

Wait, the user is asking for the required subjects for the entrance exam, not the specific programs. So the general required subjects would be the ones that all students must take, regardless of their chosen major. I think in Azerbaijan, the national exam (called the ""YKS"" in Turkey, but I'm not sure about the exact name in Azerbaijan) includes Azerbaijani language, mathematics, and a foreign language. However, I need to confirm if that's accurate.

Another point: Azerbaijan uses the ""Milli Məktəb"" system, and the entrance exams might be part of the ""Bakı Dövlət Universiteti"" or other state universities. Also, the subjects might be based on the high school curriculum. So, Azerbaijani language is definitely a core subject. Then, mathematics is common. For the foreign language, it's often English, Russian, or another European language. But is the foreign language required for all students? Or is it optional?

I should check if there's an official source. But since I can't access the internet, I'll rely on existing knowledge. From what I remember, the entrance exams in Azerbaijan require Azerbaijani language, mathematics, and a foreign language. Additionally, some universities might require specific subjects based on the program, but the general entrance exam would have those three. However, I'm not entirely certain if the foreign language is mandatory for all or just for certain programs. If I'm unsure, maybe it's safer to list the core ones and mention that additional subjects might be required for specific fields. But the user's question says ""required subjects,"" which might refer to the mandatory ones regardless of the program.

So, the answer would be Azerbaijani language",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, I need to figure out the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's culture and education system.

First, Azerbaijan is a country with a rich cultural heritage, and schools there probably have various activities that reflect local traditions. Extracurricular events can include sports, arts, cultural festivals, or community service. But which one is the most popular?

I remember that in many countries, sports events like football matches or athletic competitions are common. However, Azerbaijan has a strong tradition in music and dance, especially with groups like the ""Shuhrat"" and ""Sahil"" ensembles. Maybe cultural festivals or competitions are significant.

Wait, there's also the ""Heydar Aliyev"" Foundation, which supports various cultural initiatives. Maybe they sponsor events in schools. Alternatively, considering the country's history, events that promote national identity might be popular. For example, competitions in traditional music, dance, or poetry.

I should also think about holidays. Azerbaijan has national holidays like Independence Day, which might have school events. But the question is about regular extracurricular social events, not just holidays.

Another angle: looking at international rankings or reports. However, I don't have access to current data. Maybe common knowledge sources. For example, in some countries, school balls or proms are popular, but I don't know if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

Alternatively, considering the influence of the Soviet era, which Azerbaijan was part of, there might be a tradition of academic competitions or cultural events. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I've heard that Azerbaijan has a strong focus on music education. Maybe school music festivals or competitions are the most popular. Or perhaps inter-school sports tournaments?

Hmm. Another thought: in some countries, science fairs or robotics clubs are popular, but that might be more common in Western countries. In Azerbaijan, maybe it's more about cultural and artistic events.

Alternatively, looking at the structure of the answer. The user wants a single answer in a list. The assistant should provide the most likely answer based on available knowledge.

Given that, I think the most probable answer is that cultural festivals or competitions, particularly those involving traditional music and dance, are the most popular. However, I need to be specific. Maybe ""National Cultural Festivals"" or ""Traditional Music and Dance Competitions.""

Okay, so I need to figure out which meal is the most important for people in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and their eating habits.

First, I remember that in many countries, breakfast is considered the most important meal, but I'm not sure if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Maybe they have a different tradition. Let me think about their typical dishes. Azerbaijani cuisine includes things like plov (which is similar to rice dishes), dolma (stuffed vegetables or grape leaves), and various meats. They also have a lot of bread, which is a staple in many Middle Eastern and Caucasus countries.

Wait, I think in some cultures, the main meal is at lunch or dinner. For example, in some places, dinner is the largest meal. But I need to be specific about Azerbaijan. Let me try to remember if there's any specific information about their meal times. 

I recall that in Azerbaijan, the main meal is often considered to be the evening meal, which is similar to dinner. This might be because they have a tradition of gathering with family in the evening, and the meal is more substantial. However, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the first meal after fasting, like in some Islamic traditions, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Another angle: looking at the structure of the day. In many countries, people have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But in some cultures, the main meal is lunch. For example, in some Mediterranean countries, lunch is the largest meal. However, I need to check if that applies to Azerbaijan.

Wait, I think I've heard that in Azerbaijan, the main meal is considered to be the evening meal, which is called ""şəfəq yeməyi"" or ""evening meal."" This might be because it's a time when families come together, and they have more substantial dishes. However, I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the first meal of the day, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe it's the pre-dawn meal, like in some Islamic traditions, but that's more specific to certain practices. However, I don't think that's the case here. 

Another thought: in some countries, the most important meal is the one that's shared with guests or family. In Azerbaijan, hospitality is very important, so maybe the main meal is when they have guests over, which",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the common dress code for school teachers in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the common dress code for school teachers in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and education. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their culture is influenced by both Eastern and Western traditions. In many countries, school teachers are expected to dress professionally, but the specifics can vary.

First, I should consider the general dress code in formal settings in Azerbaijan. Traditional attire might include items like the ""chokha"" for men, but that's more for traditional events, not everyday work. For school teachers, it's probably more about professional attire. In many countries, teachers wear business casual or formal clothes. But I need to check if there are specific norms in Azerbaijan.

I remember that in some Muslim-majority countries, there might be modesty requirements, such as covering shoulders and knees. Since Azerbaijan is a Muslim country, maybe teachers are expected to dress modestly. However, Azerbaijan is secular, so it might not be as strict as some other countries. Also, urban areas might have more Western influence compared to rural regions.

Another angle: looking at neighboring countries. For example, in Turkey, teachers often wear business casual, but with modesty in mind. In Iran, the dress code is more strictly modest. Azerbaijan's dress code might be somewhere in between. However, I should not assume directly but look for specific information.

I can think about the seasons. In colder months, teachers might wear coats or sweaters, but in summer, lighter clothing. However, the question is about the common dress code, not seasonal variations. So the answer should be general.

Also, considering the education system in Azerbaijan. Public schools might have a more formal dress code compared to private institutions. However, the common standard is likely to be professional and modest.

Putting it all together, the common dress code for school teachers in Azerbaijan is probably professional and modest, avoiding overly casual or revealing clothing. It might include items like dresses, skirts, blouses, trousers, and shirts, with modesty in terms of covering shoulders and knees. However, I need to confirm if there are specific regulations or cultural expectations that dictate this.

Wait, I should check if there are any official guidelines. If there's no official source, then it's based on cultural norms. Since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. I think the answer would be that teachers are expected to dress professionally and modestly, avoiding casual wear like jeans or shorts,",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular weekday evening family activity in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the most popular weekday evening family activity in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of cultures from the Middle East and Central Asia. The capital is Baku, and the population is around 10 million people.

First, I should consider the typical family activities that might be popular in the evenings. In many countries, common activities include going out to eat, watching TV, playing games, or going for walks. But since the question specifies a weekday evening, maybe something that's done after work or school. Weekday evenings might be less about big events and more about relaxed activities.

I remember that in some Middle Eastern countries, family gatherings, eating together, or visiting relatives are common. But I need to be specific to Azerbaijan. Maybe I should think about local traditions or common practices. For example, in some places, people might go to cafes or have tea time. However, tea is a big part of Azerbaijani culture, so maybe that's a possibility. But is that typically a family activity in the evening?

Another angle: looking at the structure of a typical day. In many countries, after work (which usually ends around 6 PM), families might have dinner together. If the question is about the evening, perhaps dinner is a key activity. But is that the most popular? Or is there something else?

I should also consider the availability of facilities. For example, if there are many parks or recreational areas, maybe going for a walk or a picnic. However, in a country like Azerbaijan, which has a mix of urban and rural areas, the activities might vary. But the question is about the most popular, so it's likely something that's common across different regions.

Another thought: religious practices. Azerbaijan is predominantly Muslim, so Friday is a day of prayer. But the question is about a weekday evening, not Friday. So maybe not related to religious activities.

Looking up some sources in my mind, I recall that in Azerbaijan, family time is important. So maybe having dinner together at home. However, I'm not sure if that's the most popular activity compared to other options. Alternatively, maybe watching TV or playing board games. But again, I need to be precise.

Wait, I think I've heard that in Azerbaijan, it's common for families to gather in the evening, especially after dinner, to have tea and chat. This is part of their social culture.",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""How long is the typical probation period for new employees before signing a formal contract in Azerbaijan? (e.g., 1 month)."",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the typical probation period for new employees in Azerbaijan before they sign a formal contract. Let me start by recalling any labor laws I know about Azerbaijan. I remember that many countries have specific regulations regarding probation periods. 

First, I should check if Azerbaijan's Labor Code has any provisions on this. From what I've read before, the Labor Code of Azerbaijan might set the maximum duration for a probation period. I think in some countries, the probation period is up to a certain number of months, like three months. But I need to be sure about Azerbaijan specifically.

I also recall that in some cases, the probation period can be agreed upon between the employer and employee, but there might be a legal limit. For example, in some countries, the maximum is three months, and if the employment is for a fixed term, the probation period might be shorter. 

I should verify if there's a standard duration. Maybe the typical probation period is three months. But I need to confirm. If I can't find exact information, I might have to go with the most commonly cited figure. However, I should be cautious not to provide incorrect information. 

Wait, I think in Azerbaijan, the Labor Code allows a probation period of up to three months for indefinite employment contracts. For fixed-term contracts, the probation period is usually shorter, maybe one month. But the question is about the period before signing a formal contract. Wait, does the probation period come after the contract is signed, or before? 

Wait, the probation period is usually part of the employment contract. So perhaps the question is phrased a bit confusingly. If the employee is on probation before the formal contract is signed, maybe the probation is part of the trial period during the contract. But in many jurisdictions, the probation period is part of the employment contract. 

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a trial period before the contract is formalized. But in most cases, the probation period is included in the contract. So perhaps the user is asking about the trial period that's included in the contract. 

In that case, the answer would be that the probation period is typically up to three months, as per Azerbaijani labor laws. Let me check again. According to the Labor Code of Azerbaijan, the probation period can be agreed upon for up to three months for indefinite-term contracts. For fixed-term contracts, it's usually one month. But the question is about the typical probation period before signing a formal contract. If the employee",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What university in Azerbaijan is popular because of its engineering major? (Provide the official name.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which university in Azerbaijan is known for its engineering major. Let me start by recalling what I know about universities in Azerbaijan. The country has a few well-known higher education institutions.

First, there's the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University. I remember that it's often abbreviated as ASOIU. The name itself suggests it's focused on oil and industry, which are engineering fields. I think it's one of the top universities in the country for engineering, especially in petroleum engineering and mechanical engineering. 

Another possibility is the Azerbaijan Technical University, which might be another name for the same institution. Wait, maybe they are the same? Or are they different? Let me check my memory. I believe that Azerbaijan Technical University is the official name, and ASOIU is the abbreviation. So the official name would be Azerbaijan Technical University. 

I should also consider other universities, like the National Academy of Sciences or others, but I don't think they are as prominent in engineering. Also, Baku State University is a major university, but I think their engineering programs aren't as specialized as ASOIU's. 

To confirm, I can think about the reputation of ASOIU. It's known for producing engineers in the oil and gas sector, which is a major industry in Azerbaijan. The university has strong ties with the industry, which might contribute to its popularity. Also, the engineering programs there are likely to be well-regarded both nationally and internationally. 

So, putting it all together, the answer should be Azerbaijan Technical University, which is also known as ASOIU. Since the question asks for the official name, I need to make sure that ""Azerbaijan Technical University"" is the correct official name. Alternatively, maybe the full name includes ""State"" as in Azerbaijan State Technical University. Wait, I should verify that. 

Wait, I think the official name is Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University (ASOIU), but it's also referred to as Azerbaijan Technical University. However, the official name might be the longer one. Let me think again. In some sources, it's called Azerbaijan Technical University, but I need to check if that's the official name or an alternative name. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is Azerbaijan Technical University, and the abbreviation is ASOIU. But the user is asking for the official name. If the official name is Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University, then that's the answer. However, I might be confusing it with another university.

{""question"":""How do elementary school students in Azerbaijan go to school?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how elementary school students in Azerbaijan go to school. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's education system. First, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their education system is probably influenced by both their own traditions and possibly some Soviet-era structures since they were part of the USSR.

Elementary school in many countries typically refers to the early years of formal education. In some places, elementary school might be grades 1-4, while middle school is 5-9, and high school 10-12. I should confirm if Azerbaijan follows a similar structure. From what I remember, Azerbaijan's school system is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education. Primary education is usually for children aged 6 to 11, which would be grades 1 to 5. So elementary school might be considered the primary stage.

Now, how do students get to school? In many countries, students might walk, take public transportation like buses or trains, or be driven by parents. In rural areas, walking might be more common due to lack of transportation infrastructure. In urban areas, public transport or private vehicles might be more common. But I need to check if there are any specific details about Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan has a mix of urban and rural areas. Baku is the capital and a major city, so students there might use public transport. In rural regions, maybe walking or bicycles are more common. Also, the government might provide school buses in some areas. Are there any cultural factors? For example, in some countries, children might ride bicycles to school, but I don't know if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

Another angle: the education system in Azerbaijan is governed by the Ministry of Education. They might have policies about transportation for students. However, without specific information, I can't be sure. So the answer would be a general list of possible methods: walking, public transportation, school buses, or being driven by parents. It's important to note that the answer should be in a list without examples, just the answer points.

Wait, the user said ""Provide one single answer as a list form"" and ""without any examples."" So the answer should be a list of methods. Let me make sure I'm not adding any examples.

{""question"":""What is the most popular food in Azerbaijan among young people?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular food in Azerbaijan is among young people. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. Traditional dishes include things like plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed grape leaves), and kebabs. But the question is about what's popular with young people now.

I should consider modern trends and maybe fusion foods. Young people might be influenced by global trends, so maybe fast food or street food is popular. However, there's also a growing interest in preserving traditional foods but with a modern twist. For example, maybe dishes like ""plov"" are still popular but prepared in new ways. Alternatively, there might be a rise in cafes serving European or Middle Eastern dishes. 

I also remember that in many countries, fast food chains like McDonald's or KFC are popular among the youth. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Another angle is looking at social media trends. Maybe certain dishes are being promoted more online. 

Wait, there's also the ""manti"" (steamed dumplings) which are traditional but could be trendy. Or maybe ""ghovlou"" (a type of noodle soup) is popular. However, I'm not certain. I need to verify if there are any recent surveys or articles about food preferences in Azerbaijan. 

Alternatively, considering the country's location between East and West, maybe there's a blend of traditional and modern. Perhaps ""shish kebab"" is popular, but that's more of a street food. Another possibility is ""lavash"" (a type of flatbread) with various toppings. 

Wait, I should check if there's a specific dish that's been noted in recent times. Maybe ""plov"" is still the most popular, but I'm not sure if that's among the youth. Alternatively, maybe ""dolma"" is more traditional and less trendy. 

Alternatively, looking at the rise of coffee culture, maybe young people are more into cafes and pastries. But that's not a main dish. 

Hmm, I think I need to make an educated guess here. Since traditional dishes are still significant, but young people might prefer modern adaptations. However, without specific data, it's hard to say. But perhaps the most commonly cited dish in Azerbaijani cuisine that's also popular among youth is plov. Alternatively, maybe ""kufte"" (meatballs) or ""khinkali",1,,,1,0.25

{""question"":""What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Azerbaijan's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the key milestones for children's independence from parents in Azerbaijani society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and societal norms. 

First, in many cultures, including Azerbaijan, there are traditional expectations around when children become independent. I remember that in some countries, the age of majority is 18, which is when people can legally make their own decisions. So maybe that's a milestone. But I should check if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

Another point is education. In Azerbaijan, education is compulsory until a certain age, maybe 9 or 10? But when do children typically leave home? I think in many parts of the world, people stay with their parents until they get married or finish their education. So maybe completing higher education is a milestone. Also, getting a job could be another step towards independence.

Marriage is another big factor. In some cultures, marriage is when children leave home, so that might be a key milestone. Also, moving out of the family home, whether due to marriage, work, or other reasons. 

Financial independence might be another aspect. When children start earning their own income, they might become more independent. But I'm not sure if that's a specific milestone in Azerbaijani society compared to others.

I should also consider any cultural or legal specifics. For example, in Azerbaijan, the legal age of adulthood is 18, but social norms might push for later independence. Maybe completing military service, which is mandatory in some countries, but I think in Azerbaijan, conscription is not as prevalent now, though it might still be a factor for some.

Another angle is when children start making their own life decisions, like choosing their own careers or living arrangements. Also, societal expectations regarding gender roles might influence these milestones. For example, women might have different timelines for independence compared to men.

I need to make sure I'm not conflating general societal trends with specific Azerbaijani practices. Maybe looking at common life events: finishing school, starting work, marriage, moving out. But are there any unique aspects in Azerbaijan? For instance, the role of extended family, or the influence of the oil industry on employment opportunities for young people.

Also, the transition from adolescence to adulthood is marked by certain rites of passage. In some cultures, there are specific ceremonies or events, but I don't know if Azerbaijan has unique ones in this context.

Putting this together, possible milestones could be:

{""question"":""What is a typical festive meal in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about a typical festive meal in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that they have dishes like plov, which is a rice dish. Maybe that's a staple. Also, there's a dish called dolma, which are stuffed grape leaves or vegetables. But wait, in Azerbaijan, dolma can be made with different fillings, like rice and meat. Then there's kebabs, like shish kebab or kufte, which are meatballs. 

Cheese is also important. They have a cheese called ""tirsh"" or ""shir"" which is a salty cheese. Maybe that's served during festivals. Also, there's a dish called ""pilaf"" which is similar to plov. Oh, and maybe some types of bread, like lavash or tandir bread. 

Desserts might include something like baklava, which is common in many Middle Eastern countries. Also, there's a sweet called ""shekerbura"" which is a syrup-soaked pastry. 

Drinks could include tea, which is very important in Azerbaijani culture. Maybe also a local wine or fermented drinks, but I'm not sure if that's part of a festive meal. 

Wait, the user wants a list of the typical festive meal. So maybe the main courses would be plov, kebabs, dolma, and then some cheese and bread. Then desserts like baklava and shekerbura. Also, maybe a soup like ""shorba"" or ""pilavli shorba"". 

I should check if there are other dishes. Maybe ""khash"" which is a soup with cow's feet, but that's more of a traditional dish, not sure about festive. 

So compiling the list: plov (rice with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed vegetables), kebab (like shish kebab or kufte), cheese (tirsh), bread (lavash or tandir), and desserts like baklava and shekerbura. Also, tea is important. 

I need to make sure these are all commonly associated with festive meals. Maybe the answer should list the main dishes in order. Let me confirm the names: plov is definitely a key dish. Dolma, kebabs, then the cheese and bread. Desserts are separate. So the answer list would",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the age at which children in Azerbaijan typically become independent from their parents. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the South Caucasus region, and their culture might have traditional expectations regarding children leaving home.

First, I should consider general trends in other countries. In many Western countries, the average age is around 18-22, but in some cultures, especially in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia, children might stay with their parents longer. However, Azerbaijan has been influenced by various cultures over time, including Persian, Russian, and Turkish.

I remember that in some post-Soviet countries, there's a trend where young people might leave home around 18-20, but economic factors can play a role. If the economy is strong, maybe they can move out earlier. If not, they might stay longer. However, I don't have specific data on Azerbaijan. 

I might need to check if there are any statistics or cultural practices. For example, some sources suggest that in Azerbaijan, it's common for children to live with their parents until marriage, which might be around late 20s or even 30s. But that's for marriage, not necessarily full independence. However, the question is about becoming independent, which could mean living separately, having their own job, and managing their own finances.

Another angle: education. If children go to university, they might move out at 18, but if they stay at home, they might not be independent. So maybe the age varies. However, the question is about the typical age. I need to find a general answer.

Looking up some references (even though I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge). From what I recall, in many parts of the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan, young people often stay with their parents until they get married, which could be in their mid to late 20s. However, some might leave earlier if they find a job or have other opportunities. But the typical or average age might be around 20-25. But I'm not sure if there's a specific number commonly cited.

{""question"":""What is the most common form of private education in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the most common form of private education in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about education systems in different countries. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and they have both public and private education systems. Private education might include things like private schools, tutoring, or maybe even international schools.

First, I should check if there are any well-known private schools in Azerbaijan. I remember hearing about some international schools, like the British International School or the American School, but are those the most common? Or maybe there are more local private schools that follow the national curriculum but are privately run.

Another angle is to consider the structure of the education system. In many countries, private education can take the form of boarding schools, but I'm not sure if that's prevalent in Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe private tutoring is common, especially for subjects like math or languages. However, the question specifies ""form of private education,"" which might refer to institutions rather than individual tutoring.

I should also think about the percentage of students in private vs. public schools. If public education is the main system, private might be a smaller portion. But the question is about the most common form within private education. So even if private schools are a minority, what is the most common type among them?

Looking up some information (even though I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge), I think in many countries, private schools that follow the national curriculum but offer better resources or smaller class sizes are more common than international schools. However, in Azerbaijan, there might be a significant number of international schools catering to expatriates or those seeking foreign qualifications. But if the majority of private schools are local, then maybe the answer is private schools following the Azerbaijani curriculum.

Wait, but the user is asking for the most common form. If international schools are fewer in number but private schools in general are more common, then the answer would be private schools. But I need to be precise. Another possibility is that private education in Azerbaijan is often in the form of private tutoring centers or supplementary classes, but that's more of a supplementary education rather than the main form.

Alternatively, maybe the most common form is private higher education institutions, but the question doesn't specify the level. It just says ""private education,"" which could include primary, secondary, or tertiary levels. However, primary and secondary education are more common in terms of numbers.

Considering all this, I think the most common form of private",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""What is a common snack for preschool kids in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out a common snack for preschool kids in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. They have a variety of dishes, but I'm not sure about specific snacks for children.

First, I should think about traditional foods that are commonly eaten by kids. Maybe something sweet or savory? In many countries, fruits are common snacks for kids. Azerbaijan is in the Caucasus region, so maybe they have fruits like apples, pears, or grapes. But is there something more specific?

Another thought: Azerbaijan has a dish called ""pilaf,"" but that's a main meal, not a snack. Maybe something like ""halva,"" which is a sweet made from tahini, but that's more of a dessert. Then there's ""chips"" or ""potato chips,"" but those are more Western. However, maybe they have local versions of snacks.

Wait, I remember that in some parts of the Caucasus, they have ""qutab"" which is a type of pancake, but again, that's more of a meal. Maybe ""sugarcane"" or ""dates"" are common? Or perhaps ""biscuits"" or ""cookies"" that are popular there.

Alternatively, considering that Azerbaijan has a mix of Turkic and Persian influences, maybe they have something like ""baklava,"" but that's also a dessert. I'm not sure if that's typical for preschoolers.

Another angle: looking at common snacks in other countries, like in Turkey, they have ""kabak"" (pumpkin) or ""balık ekmek"" (fish bread), but I don't know if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Maybe ""milk"" or ""cheese"" products? Or ""yogurt"" with honey?

Wait, I think I've heard of ""paklava"" (similar to baklava) being a common treat. But again, is that a snack for kids? Maybe. Alternatively, ""qara qahve"" is a black tea, but that's not a snack.

Alternatively, maybe ""sweets"" in general. But I need something more specific. Let me check if there's a common snack that's specifically mentioned in Azerbaijani culture for children. Maybe ""mujjaran"" which is a type of sweet roll, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe ""nuts"" or ""dried fruits"" are common. Or perhaps ""samosas""",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What symbolic food do people from Azerbaijan eat on (Lunar) New Year?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the symbolic food that people in Azerbaijan eat during the Lunar New Year. Hmm, first, I need to confirm whether Azerbaijan actually celebrates the Lunar New Year. Wait, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and they primarily follow the solar calendar for their New Year celebrations. The Lunar New Year is more commonly associated with East Asian countries like China, Korea, Vietnam, etc.

But maybe there's some cultural exchange or minority communities in Azerbaijan that observe the Lunar New Year? I should check that. Alternatively, perhaps the user is confused and meant the traditional New Year, which in Azerbaijan is celebrated on January 1st. However, the question specifically mentions Lunar New Year.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Azerbaijan's New Year is not based on the lunar calendar. So, if the question is about Lunar New Year, maybe the answer is that they don't traditionally celebrate it, but if they do, perhaps they adopt some foods from other cultures. However, I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different tradition or a specific dish that's symbolic in their own New Year, which is solar-based.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is conflating different traditions. Let me think. In Azerbaijan, the traditional New Year is called ""Novruz,"" which is a spring festival, not tied to the lunar calendar. Novruz is celebrated on the first day of spring, around March 21st. The symbolic foods for Novruz include things like sumalak (a wheat germ porridge), plov (rice dish), and various sweets. But that's for Novruz, not Lunar New Year.

So if the question is about Lunar New Year, which isn't a traditional holiday in Azerbaijan, the answer might be that they don't have a specific symbolic food for it. However, the user might be expecting an answer based on a different context. Wait, but the user's question says ""(Lunar) New Year"" with parentheses, which might indicate that they are referring to the Lunar New Year but are aware that Azerbaijan's New Year is different. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the name of the holiday.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific dish that's eaten during the Lunar New Year in Azerbaijan, but I'm not aware of it. I should check sources. However, based on my knowledge, Azerbaijan's New Year is not Lunar. Therefore, the answer might be that they don't traditionally eat any specific symbolic food",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""What religion is mainly taught in schools in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking what religion is mainly taught in schools in Azerbaijan. First, I need to recall what I know about Azerbaijan's religious education.

Azerbaijan is a secular country, right? They have a constitution that separates religion from the state. The main religion there is Islam, but I think it's more about the cultural aspect rather than religious instruction in schools. Wait, but do they teach religion in schools?

I remember that in some countries, even if they are secular, they might have religious education as part of the curriculum. But in Azerbaijan, the government has been promoting secularism. Also, the majority of the population is Muslim, so maybe there's some Islamic education, but not as a main subject.

Wait, but I should check if there are any laws or policies about this. From what I know, the Azerbaijani government doesn't enforce religious education in schools. Instead, they focus on secular subjects. However, there might be some courses on the history of religion or cultural aspects, but not teaching a specific religion as the main subject.

So the answer would be that the main religion taught isn't a specific one, but rather secular education. But the question is phrased as ""what religion is mainly taught,"" which might be a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is that no specific religion is mainly taught, but the country's primary religion is Islam, though it's not the focus in schools.

Alternatively, perhaps they have some Islamic studies, but not as a main subject. However, the user is asking for the religion that is mainly taught. If there's no specific religion taught, then the answer would be that secular education is the focus, and religion isn't the main subject. But the user might be expecting Islam as the answer because it's the majority religion, even if it's not the main subject in schools.

Wait, I need to be accurate. Let me think again. In Azerbaijan, the state is secular, and the education system is secular as well. So while the majority of people are Muslim, the schools don't teach a specific religion. They might have some cultural or historical references, but not religious instruction. Therefore, the main religion taught in schools isn't a specific one. However, the user might be looking for Islam as the answer, but that's the predominant religion of the population, not necessarily what's taught in schools.

So the correct answer would be that no specific religion is mainly taught in schools, but the country's main religion is Islam",1,,,,

{""question"":""What do people eat on their birthday in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about what people eat on their birthday in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall any information I have about Azerbaijani cuisine and traditions. I know that in many countries, birthdays are celebrated with specific dishes, often reflecting the local culture. Azerbaijan is a country with a mix of Persian, Turkish, and Caucasian influences, so their food might have elements from those regions.

I remember that in some countries, like in the Caucasus region, there's a tradition of eating certain dishes on birthdays. For example, I think there's a dish called ""pilaf"" which is common in many Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries. Maybe that's part of it. Also, there's a dish called ""dolma,"" which are stuffed vegetables or grape leaves. But I'm not sure if that's specifically for birthdays.

Another possibility is ""kufte,"" which are meatballs or meatballs wrapped in dough. Or maybe ""qutab,"" which are savory pancakes. Wait, but are these specifically for birthdays? I might be mixing up general dishes with birthday-specific ones.

I should also consider if there are any traditional sweets or desserts. In many cultures, birthdays include cakes or sweet treats. In Azerbaijan, there's ""shekerbura,"" which are syrup-soaked pastries. Maybe that's part of the birthday meal. Also, ""baklava"" is a common dessert in the region, but again, not sure if it's specific to birthdays.

Another angle: sometimes, the first dish served on a birthday might have symbolic meaning. For example, in some cultures, certain foods are believed to bring good luck. However, I'm not certain about Azerbaijani-specific symbolism.

I should check if there's a traditional birthday cake or any specific dishes. Maybe ""gurme"" which is a type of layered bread, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the main course might be a meat dish like kebabs, but that's more general.

Wait, I think I've heard that in Azerbaijan, people might eat ""sahur"" or ""sumak"" on birthdays. Wait, ""sumak"" is a type of flatbread. Or perhaps ""manti,"" which are dumplings. But again, not sure if that's birthday-specific.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no specific dish, but people eat traditional meals. However, the user is asking for what they eat, so there must be some common dishes.",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, I need to figure out which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Azerbaijan attend most frequently. Let me start by recalling what I know about education in Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan has a system where public schools are common, but there are also private and specialized academies. I remember that there are some well-known private institutions, especially in the capital, Baku. For example, there's the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University, but that's more for higher education. Wait, the question is about middle or high school students, so maybe not universities.

I think there are private schools that focus on specific subjects. Maybe languages? Like English or Russian, since those are commonly taught. Or perhaps math and science, as those are often emphasized in competitive exams. Alternatively, there might be specialized academies for arts or music.

Wait, I've heard of the ""Azerbaijan Mathematical School"" or something similar. But I'm not sure if that's a private institution. Also, there's the ""Baku State University,"" but again, that's higher education. Maybe the most common private institutes are for preparing students for the entrance exams to universities, which are highly competitive in Azerbaijan. So they might offer tutoring in subjects like math, physics, chemistry, or the humanities.

Alternatively, considering the influence of the oil industry, maybe engineering or technical subjects are popular. But I'm not certain. Another angle: in many countries, private tutoring centers for subjects like math and science are common. So perhaps in Azerbaijan, similar institutes for these subjects are frequent.

Wait, there's also the possibility of language institutes. Since English is widely taught, maybe private language schools are common. However, the question specifies ""academy/private educational institute,"" which might be more structured than just language schools.

I should check if there are any notable private academies in Azerbaijan. For example, the ""Azerbaijan Lyceum of Informatics and Mathematics"" is a public institution, but there might be private counterparts. Alternatively, the ""Azerbaijan State Economic University"" has a lyceum, but again, public.

Another thought: in some countries, private institutes for preparing for the Gaokao or similar exams are common. Azerbaijan has the National Unified Entrance Examination (NUV), so maybe private institutes that help students prepare for that. These institutes might focus on the core subjects tested: math, physics, chemistry, biology, and humanities like history and literature.

{""question"":""Which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about the education system in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their education system is influenced by both Soviet-era structures and more recent reforms. The main subjects taught in schools there would include things like mathematics, science, literature, history, and languages like Azerbaijani and Russian.

But the question is about which subject is considered the most important. In many countries, subjects like mathematics and science are often emphasized because they are foundational for many other fields and are important for economic development. However, in some contexts, subjects like history or the national language might be prioritized for cultural reasons.

Azerbaijan has a strong focus on the Azerbaijani language as part of national identity. The country has been working on promoting the use of Azerbaijani in education, which might make it a significant subject. However, I also know that during the Soviet period, Russian was widely used in education, and even now, Russian is taught as a second language. But whether that makes it the most important is unclear.

Another angle is the entrance exams for higher education. In many countries, subjects like mathematics, physics, and chemistry are crucial for university admissions. If Azerbaijani students have to take standardized tests in these subjects, they might be considered more important. However, I should check if there are any specific policies or educational reforms that highlight a particular subject.

I also recall that Azerbaijan has been investing in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education to boost its economy and reduce reliance on oil. This could mean that subjects like math and science are prioritized. However, the national language and history are also important for maintaining cultural heritage.

Wait, but the question is about what is considered the most important, not necessarily what is being prioritized for economic reasons. Public opinion or educational policies might differ. If the government emphasizes a certain subject in the curriculum or in exams, that might indicate its importance.

Looking up some information (even though I can't browse the internet), I know that in Azerbaijan, the national language is a key subject. The government has been promoting the use of Azerbaijani in schools, which might make it a central subject. However, in practice, many students also learn Russian, and subjects like math and science are still critical for higher education.

But I need to be careful not to assume. If I can't find",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what food items people in Azerbaijan typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine and drinking habits.

First, Azerbaijan is a country with a rich culinary tradition influenced by its location between the Caucasus and Central Asia. They have a variety of dishes, some of which are quite rich and flavorful. Now, when it comes to pairing food with hard liquor, like vodka or brandy, which are common in the region, I think the key is to find dishes that can complement the strong flavors of the alcohol without clashing.

I remember that in many cultures, salty or savory foods are paired with alcohol to balance the taste. For example, in Russia, people often eat pickled vegetables or salty snacks with vodka. Since Azerbaijan has similar cultural influences, maybe they have similar pairings. Let me think about traditional Azerbaijani foods. Dishes like dolma (stuffed grape leaves), kebabs, pilaf, and various meats are common. Also, there's a lot of use of herbs and spices in their cooking.

But wait, hard liquor is strong, so maybe they pair it with something that can cut through the alcohol's intensity. Pickles, salted fish, or cheese might be options. Also, I've heard of people eating nuts or dried fruits with alcohol. Maybe Azerbaijani people have specific dishes for that. Another thought: in some regions, they might serve appetizers or mezze-style dishes with liquor. Could that be the case here?

I should also consider if there are any local specialties that are traditionally served with hard liquor. For example, in some parts of the Caucasus, they might have dishes like khinkali (dumplings) or other types of dumplings, but I'm not sure if that's specific to Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe they serve certain cheeses or cured meats. Also, considering the availability of ingredients, maybe they use local products like sausages or specific types of bread.

Wait, I think I've heard of Azerbaijani people eating something called ""qara qoz"" which is a type of black caviar, but I'm not sure if that's paired with hard liquor. Alternatively, maybe they have a dish similar to shish kebab, which is grilled meat. But grilled meats are usually more of a main course, not an appetizer.

Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular family pet in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about pets in different countries. In many places, dogs are the most common pets, but maybe in Azerbaijan there's something different.

First, I should consider the cultural and historical context of Azerbaijan. The country has a mix of cultures, including Turkic and Persian influences. I remember that in some Middle Eastern countries, cats are also popular, but I'm not sure about Azerbaijan specifically.

I should check if there are any specific breeds or animals that are commonly kept as pets there. Maybe looking into local traditions or common household pets. Also, considering the climate, maybe certain animals are more suited to the environment. However, dogs and cats are generally adaptable.

I wonder if there are any statistics or surveys about pet ownership in Azerbaijan. If I can't find exact data, maybe I can infer based on neighboring countries. For example, in Turkey, dogs are very popular, but I'm not certain if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

Another angle: maybe the answer is a specific breed. For instance, some countries have a particular breed that's favored. But the question is about the most popular family pet in general, not a specific breed. So it's more about the type of animal rather than a breed.

I should also think about other possible pets. Are there many people who keep birds, rabbits, or other small animals? But again, dogs are typically the most common in many regions.

Wait, maybe I should consider if there's any unique tradition in Azerbaijan. For example, some countries have a tradition of keeping certain animals as pets. However, I don't recall anything specific about Azerbaijan in that regard.

If I can't find specific information, the safest answer might be dogs, as they are the most common family pets worldwide. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe cats are more popular there. I think in some parts of the world, cats are more common due to their low maintenance, but again, not sure about Azerbaijan.

Another thought: perhaps the answer is a specific animal that's native to the region. However, Azerbaijan's native animals include things like the Caspian tiger, but that's endangered and not a typical pet. So probably not.

In conclusion, without specific data, the best guess is that dogs are the most popular family pets in Azerbaijan, similar to many other countries. But I should verify this if possible. However, since I can't look it up right now",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of cultures. They have a rich history in sports, especially in wrestling, which is traditional. But the question is about an indoor sport.

First, I should consider common indoor sports globally. Sports like basketball, football (soccer), volleyball, table tennis, chess, and maybe even things like badminton or boxing. But which of these are popular in Azerbaijan?

I remember that Azerbaijan has a strong presence in sports like wrestling, which is traditional and often practiced in open areas or gyms. However, wrestling might be more of a traditional sport rather than a modern indoor one. Then there's football, which is popular worldwide, but is it considered an indoor sport? No, football is played outdoors. So maybe indoor football? But I'm not sure if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

Another angle: looking at the sports where Azerbaijan has notable athletes or teams. For example, in boxing, Azerbaijan has produced several champions. Boxing is an indoor sport. But is it the most popular? Or maybe chess? Azerbaijan has a strong chess tradition, with players like Teimour Radjabov. Chess is definitely an indoor sport. However, popularity might depend on the number of participants versus spectators.

Wait, but the question is about the most popular indoor sport. So popularity could be measured by participation numbers, media coverage, or spectatorship. If I think about the country's sports culture, wrestling is very traditional, but it's often practiced in open-air venues or specialized gyms. However, if we consider indoor sports, maybe basketball or volleyball?

Alternatively, considering the infrastructure. Do they have a lot of indoor sports facilities? For example, if they have many basketball courts or volleyball halls. I'm not sure. Maybe the most popular is wrestling, but that's not strictly indoor. Alternatively, maybe chess is the most popular indoor sport in terms of participation or cultural significance.

Wait, I should check if there's any official data or sources. But since I can't access external information, I have to rely on existing knowledge. Another thought: Azerbaijan has a national team in sports like judo, which is an indoor sport. However, I'm not certain about its popularity compared to others.

Alternatively, considering the popularity of sports in the media. If Azerbaijani media covers certain indoor sports more, that might indicate popularity.",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which food is a cost-effective and quick meal option in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which food in Azerbaijan is both cost-effective and quick to make. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. They have dishes like plov, which is a rice dish with meat and vegetables. Then there's dolma, which are stuffed grape leaves or vegetables. Also, there's khinkali, which are dumplings. But wait, are those quick to prepare?

Plov is a staple, but it might take some time to cook the rice and meat. Dolma might be quicker if you use pre-made grape leaves, but traditionally they're made from scratch. Khinkali are more like meat dumplings, which could be time-consuming to make from scratch. Maybe there's something simpler.

Then there's the bread, like lavash or nan. But that's just bread, not a full meal. What about soups? Maybe a simple soup with some local ingredients. Or maybe something like shish kebab, but that's more of a street food and might not be the quickest at home.

Wait, there's also a dish called ""pilaf,"" which is similar to plov but maybe quicker? Or maybe ""dolma"" if using ready-made. Another thought: maybe ""ghoresh"" which is a type of stew, but again, not sure about the time. 

Alternatively, maybe a sandwich with local fillings? But I'm not sure if that's traditional. Let me think again. In many countries, dishes like lentil soup or bean dishes are quick and cheap. Does Azerbaijan have something similar? Maybe ""shorba,"" which is a soup. But I'm not certain if that's the most common or cost-effective.

Wait, I remember that ""plov"" is very popular and might be one of the more affordable dishes because it uses rice, which is a staple. But is it quick? If you have the ingredients prepped, maybe. But if you're cooking from scratch, it might take time. Alternatively, maybe ""dolma"" can be made quickly if using frozen or pre-stuffed ones.

Alternatively, ""khinkali"" are dumplings, but again, making them from scratch takes time. Maybe there's a street food option that's quick and cheap. Like ""manti"" which are smaller dumplings, but again, not sure about preparation time.

Wait, maybe ""sujuk"" which is a type of sausage, but that's more of a meat product.",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""Which professional sport is the highest paying in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which professional sport is the highest paying in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is a country that has a strong presence in certain sports, like wrestling and weightlifting. They've had success in the Olympics and other international competitions in those areas.

But the question is about which sport is the highest paying. That's different from which sport they excel in. So I need to consider the revenue generated from these sports. Professional sports in Azerbaijan might include things like football (soccer), basketball, boxing, or maybe even motorsports. However, I'm not sure about the exact figures.

Football is a popular sport globally and often has high revenues, but I don't know if Azerbaijan's football league is among the top earners. Maybe there are wealthy individuals or sponsors in Azerbaijan who invest in certain sports. For example, boxing might have high-profile athletes who earn a lot from fights and sponsorships. But again, I'm not certain.

Another angle: Azerbaijan has a national team in sports like wrestling, which is a traditional strength. However, wrestlers might not earn as much as athletes in sports with higher commercialization. Maybe there's a sport that's more popular or has more media coverage, leading to higher salaries.

I should check if there are any known high-earning athletes from Azerbaijan. For instance, if there's a famous footballer or boxer from there who's part of a top league or has endorsement deals. But without specific data, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no professional sports industry in Azerbaijan, but that doesn't seem right. They do have professional leagues and athletes. Another thought: maybe sports like chess, since Azerbaijan has strong chess players. But chess isn't typically a high-paying sport compared to others.

Wait, I remember that in some countries, sports like boxing or MMA can be lucrative if the athletes are top-tier. But again, I need to think about the context of Azerbaijan. Maybe the highest paying is football, as it's the most popular, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's not a traditional team sport but something else.

Since I don't have exact data, I might need to go with the most plausible answer based on available knowledge. Given Azerbaijan's Olympic success in wrestling and weightlifting, but those might not be the highest paying. Football (soccer) is more commercialized, so perhaps that's the answer. However, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Who is the most popular volleyball player in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular volleyball player in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling any information I have about Azerbaijani volleyball players. I know that Azerbaijan has a national volleyball team, both men's and women's. But I'm not sure about specific players.

Maybe I should think about athletes from Azerbaijan who are well-known in general. For example, I know that Azerbaijan has produced some successful athletes in sports like wrestling and weightlifting, but volleyball might not be as prominent. However, there might be a few notable players.

I remember that in the 2016 Olympics, Azerbaijan's men's volleyball team participated. Maybe one of the players from that team is popular. Alternatively, perhaps there are players who have been part of the national team for a long time and have gained recognition. 

Another angle is to check if there are any Azerbaijan-born players who have played in major leagues abroad. Sometimes players who play in popular leagues like the Italian or Turkish leagues can gain more visibility. For example, maybe a player who has been in a top European league is more popular.

Wait, I think there's a player named Elmar Gasimov. He's a volleyball player from Azerbaijan. Let me verify that. Yes, Elmar Gasimov is a well-known Azerbaijani volleyball player who has played for the national team. He's been part of the team in various international competitions. He might be considered one of the most popular due to his consistent performance and experience.

Alternatively, could there be a female player who is more popular? I'm not as familiar with female Azerbaijani volleyball players. Maybe someone like Gular Aghayeva? She's a well-known female volleyball player from Azerbaijan. She has played for the national team as well. However, I'm not sure about her current popularity compared to male players.

But the question doesn't specify gender, so I need to consider both. However, in many countries, male athletes tend to have higher visibility in sports. But that's not always the case. Let me try to check if there are any recent awards or recognitions. For example, if a player has been recognized as the best in the country or has won major titles.

Another thought: sometimes the most popular player could be the one who has been with the national team the longest or has the most social media followers. If I can't find specific data, I might have to go with the most commonly mentioned player in media or sports news from Azerbaijan.

{""question"":""How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about the education system in Azerbaijan. Middle school in Azerbaijan typically refers to the secondary education stage, which is usually grades 6 to 9. Now, the number of subjects can vary depending on the curriculum and the specific school, but I need to find a standard answer.

First, I should check the official curriculum of Azerbaijan. The Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan sets the national curriculum. From what I remember, the core subjects in middle school include subjects like Azerbaijani language and literature, mathematics, science (which might be split into biology, physics, chemistry), history, geography, foreign languages (usually English), physical education, music, art, and maybe some social studies or civics. There might also be subjects like computer science or information technology.

Wait, but how many exactly? Let me think. In many countries, middle school subjects can range from 10 to 15, but I need to be precise here. Let me try to list them out as per Azerbaijani curriculum:

1. Azerbaijani Language and Literature
2. Mathematics
3. Science (could be separate subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
4. History of Azerbaijan and World History
5. Geography
6. Foreign Language (English, Russian, etc.)
7. Physical Education
8. Music
9. Art
10. Computer Science
11. Civic Education
12. Religious Studies (optional, but sometimes included)
13. Technology and Labor Education

Hmm, that's 13 subjects. But I might be missing some or including others. Also, some subjects might be combined. For example, Science might be a single subject covering multiple areas, or split into separate ones. Also, depending on the school, there might be elective subjects, but the core curriculum would have a set number.

Alternatively, I found in some sources that the standard curriculum for middle school in Azerbaijan includes around 12 subjects. Let me cross-verify. Another angle: the Azerbaijani education system follows a structure similar to other countries in the region. For example, in some sources, it's mentioned that middle school students study 12 core subjects. These include:

- Azerbaijani Language and Literature
- Mathematics
- Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
- History

Okay, so I need to figure out what food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. They have dishes like plov, dolma, kebabs, and various types of soups. Now, thinking about foods that might be less appealing to kids but more so for older people.

Maybe something with strong flavors or ingredients that are more common in traditional dishes. For example, some dishes might have a lot of garlic or certain herbs that children might not like. Another thought is fermented foods, like fermented vegetables or cheeses, which are common in some cultures. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

Wait, there's a dish called ""tavuk göğsü,"" which is a milk-based soup with chicken breast. It's quite mild, but maybe not the one. Then there's ""shish kebab"" which is grilled meat, but children might like that. What about ""dolma""? Those are stuffed grape leaves or vegetables, but again, not sure about the age preference.

Another angle: some traditional dishes might be more comforting for the elderly, perhaps something with a longer cooking time or more complex flavors. Maybe ""pilaf"" (plov) is too common and not specific. Or perhaps ""kərələ"" which is a type of noodle soup. Wait, but I need to find something that children dislike but elderly like.

Wait, I remember hearing that ""tərəvə"" (a type of fermented cheese or yogurt product) might be something that's more appreciated by older people. Or maybe ""məmməd"" which is a type of fermented milk. Alternatively, ""kərələ"" is a soup made with noodles, meat, and vegetables. Maybe that's too mild. 

Alternatively, maybe ""qara qahve"" (black coffee), but that's a drink. The question is about food. Another possibility is ""sığır qızı"" (beef tongue), which is a delicacy but might not be liked by children. Or ""tavuk qızı"" (chicken feet), which are sometimes used in soups. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I've heard that ""qara qaymaq"" (black cream) is a traditional dish. It's a type of sour cream or yogurt with added ingredients. It might have a strong",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What do people look forward to the most at university festivals in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people look forward to the most at university festivals in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and university life there.

First, university festivals are likely similar to other countries, with events like music, food, and cultural activities. But there might be specific elements unique to Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has a rich cultural heritage, including traditional music, dance, and cuisine. So maybe traditional performances are a big part of these festivals.

Also, considering the climate, Azerbaijan has a variety of landscapes, from Caspian Sea coast to mountains. Maybe outdoor activities or events that take advantage of the environment are popular. However, festivals are usually in autumn or spring, so maybe not too weather-dependent.

Another angle is social aspects. University students often look forward to meeting friends, networking, and having fun. So social events, games, or competitions might be important. But the question asks for what they look forward to the most, so it's probably a specific highlight.

I should also think about any notable festivals in Azerbaijani universities. For example, events like the ""Baku International Music Festival"" or other cultural celebrations. But maybe more specific to university settings, like cultural showcases, talent shows, or sports events.

Wait, the user is asking for the most anticipated part. In many places, food stalls or traditional dishes are a big draw. Azerbaijan has delicious cuisine like plov, kebabs, and various sweets. So maybe the food is a major attraction.

Alternatively, performances by local artists or traditional dance groups could be a highlight. Or maybe competitions like poetry recitation, which is a traditional art form in Azerbaijan.

Another possibility is the opportunity to showcase their own talents, like in music or dance, which students might look forward to. Or perhaps the festive atmosphere with decorations and activities that create a lively environment.

But since the answer needs to be a single list item, I need to determine the top one. If I had to choose, I think cultural performances and traditional food might be the main attractions. However, considering the social aspect, maybe the overall experience of celebration and community coming together is key.

Wait, but the question is about what they look forward to the most. In many university festivals, the main events are often the cultural performances, music, and dance. So combining that with the traditional aspects, the answer might be the cultural performances and traditional food. However, the user wants one answer in a list. Hmm.

Okay, I need to figure out where high school students in Azerbaijan usually go after dinner. Let me start by considering the cultural and social norms in Azerbaijan. 

First, family is very important in Azerbaijani culture. So maybe after dinner, students might stay home with their families. But high school students might also have social activities. Let me think about common after-school activities.

In many countries, students might go to the park, hang out with friends, or use social media. But in Azerbaijan, there might be specific places. For example, public spaces like parks or cafes could be options. However, since they are high school students, maybe they have homework or study sessions. Alternatively, they might go to a local café or hang out in a public area.

Wait, but the question is about after dinner. So maybe family time is more important. However, if they have friends, they might meet up. I should check if there are any common places. Another angle: in some countries, students might go to a nearby park or plaza. In Baku, the capital, there are places like the Fountain Square or parks. But I'm not sure if that's typical for high schoolers.

Alternatively, since Azerbaijan has a strong emphasis on education, maybe students study at home after dinner. Or perhaps they go to a library. But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that they might go to a local café with friends. However, without specific data, this is speculative.

Considering that the answer should be concise and in a list, the most likely answer is that they stay home with their families or study. But maybe the answer is more about socializing. I need to make an educated guess based on cultural norms. Since family is central, staying home is a possibility, but also socializing with friends. However, the question says ""usually,"" so the most common place. Maybe they go to a park or public area. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they have no specific place and just relax at home.

Wait, I should check if there's any information on typical after-dinner activities for Azerbaijani teens. If I can't find specific data, I have to go with general assumptions. In many Muslim-majority countries, after dinner, people might relax at home, pray, or spend time with family. High school students might have homework, so studying at home is possible. Alternatively, they might go out with friends, but that depends on local customs.

Considering all this, the safest answer might",1,,,1,1.0
