{""question"":""Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Indonesia's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian culture and traditions.

First, I know that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some Asian countries, turning 60 is a big deal because it's a milestone in life. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Indonesia. Also, Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country, so maybe there are Islamic traditions that influence this.

Wait, in Islam, there's a concept called ""walimah"" which is a celebration for a wedding, but I'm not sure about birthdays. However, some Muslim communities might celebrate birthdays for children, especially for the first birthday, called ""tasyakuran"" or ""makanan tasyakuran."" But I think that's more for the first birthday. However, the question is about the age that's celebrated the most grandly, not just any birthday.

Another angle: in Indonesia, there's a tradition called ""Ulang Tahun"" which is birthday in Indonesian. But I think the most significant might be the 1st birthday, similar to the Western ""first birthday"" party. However, I'm not certain if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the 10th or 15th birthday, which are considered important in some cultures. But I'm not sure about Indonesia specifically.

Wait, I remember that in some parts of Indonesia, the 60th birthday is considered a big milestone because it's a round number and in some traditions, it's seen as a significant age. Also, in Javanese culture, which is part of Indonesia, there's a tradition called ""Sedekah Bumi"" which is a thanksgiving ceremony, but I'm not sure if that's tied to a specific age.

Alternatively, maybe the 1st birthday is more commonly celebrated with a big party. However, considering the influence of Western culture, maybe the 18th birthday (coming of age) is significant. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Indonesia.

Wait, I should check if there's any specific age that's more prominent. For example, in some cultures, the 50th birthday is considered a major event. However, without specific knowledge, I need to think about what's more common.

Another thought: in Indonesia, the 1st birthday (ulang tahun pertama) is often celebrated with",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""What sport is popular to play on the beach in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what sport is popular on the beach in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesia. It's an archipelago with many islands, and beaches are a big part of their landscape. They have a lot of coastal areas, so beach activities must be common there.

First, I think about common beach sports. Volleyball comes to mind, like beach volleyball. That's popular in many countries with beaches. But I'm not sure if it's specifically popular in Indonesia. Then there's surfing. Indonesia has some famous surfing spots, like Bali. I've heard of surfers going there, so maybe surfing is a possibility.

Another sport could be swimming, but that's more of an individual activity rather than a sport played on the beach. Then there's maybe something like beach cricket or football (soccer), but I don't think those are specifically beach-based. Wait, there's also a sport called ""volleyball"" but played on sand, which is beach volleyball. That's definitely a beach sport.

But I should check if there's a more specific answer. Maybe there's a traditional sport from Indonesia that's played on the beach. I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe something like ""sepak takraw,"" which is a traditional sport similar to volleyball but using a rattan ball. However, I think sepak takraw is more commonly played in courts rather than on beaches, though it could be played on sand.

Another angle: Indonesia has a lot of tourism, and tourists might engage in sports like snorkeling or scuba diving, but those are water activities, not sports played on the beach. Then there's also ""beach soccer,"" which is a variant of football played on sand. I'm not certain if that's popular in Indonesia specifically.

Wait, I remember that in many Southeast Asian countries, volleyball is a popular sport. Indonesia has a national volleyball team, and beach volleyball might be played there as well. Also, considering the climate, with warm weather and sandy beaches, volleyball makes sense. But I need to confirm if it's the most popular.

Alternatively, maybe ""kite surfing"" or ""stand-up paddleboarding"" are popular, but those are more niche. The question asks for the sport that's popular, so it's likely a more mainstream activity. Between volleyball and surfing, which is more common? In Bali, surfing is definitely a big thing. However, beach volleyball might be more of a team sport that's organized, whereas",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What soccer teams in Indonesia are famous for their intense rivalry? (e.g. ___ vs ___)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which soccer teams in Indonesia are known for having intense rivalries. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian football. The top league is Liga 1, and there are several prominent clubs.

First, there's Persipura Jayapura from Papua. They have a strong fan base and a history of success. Then there's Persija Jakarta, which is based in Jakarta and has a large following. I remember hearing about a rivalry between Persija and Persipura, maybe called the ""Derby of the East"" or something similar. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the main rivalry.

Another big team is PSM Makassar from Makassar. They have a significant fan base in Sulawesi. There's also Arema FC from Malang, which is part of the Arema family, known for their passionate fans. Arema has had some intense matches against other teams, maybe against Persebaya Surabaya? Persebaya is another major team in East Java. The rivalry between Arema and Persebaya is quite famous; they're called the ""Derby Jawa Timur"" or East Java Derby. That's a big one.

Then there's PSIS Semarang and PSS Sleman. I think there's a rivalry between them too, maybe called the ""Derby of Central Java"" or something like that. Also, Persib Bandung is a major club in West Java. They have a rivalry with PSM Makassar, but I'm not sure if that's as intense as the Arema vs Persebaya one.

Wait, another rivalry might be between Persija Jakarta and Persib Bandung. Those two teams are from different regions but have had some intense matches. However, I think the most famous rivalries are the ones within the same region. So, the Arema vs Persebaya derby in East Java is definitely a top one. Also, the PSM vs Persipura rivalry, though I'm not entirely certain about the name of that rivalry. Alternatively, maybe the PSM vs Persela Lamongan? Not sure.

Let me check my memory again. The most well-known rivalries in Indonesia are:

1. Arema FC vs Persebaya Surabaya (East Java Derby)
2. Persija Jakarta vs Persipura Jayapura (Derby of the East or something similar)
3. PSM Makassar vs Persip",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Where do families gather to pray together in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking where families in Indonesia gather to pray together. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country, so the main places of worship would be mosques. But the question specifies families gathering to pray together. In many Muslim cultures, families might pray at home, especially for daily prayers. However, for communal prayers, especially on Fridays or during special occasions, they might go to the mosque.

But wait, the question is about where they gather. So maybe the answer includes both homes and mosques? However, the user wants one answer in a list. Let me verify. In Indonesia, it's common for families to pray together at home, especially for daily prayers like Fajr, Dhuhr, etc. However, for Jumu'ah (Friday) prayers, they might go to the mosque. But the question doesn't specify the type of prayer. 

Alternatively, maybe the main answer is the mosque, as that's the primary place for communal prayers. But I should check if there are other places. Are there other religious sites? Indonesia has other religions too, like Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Confucian, but the majority are Muslim. The question doesn't specify the religion, but since it's Indonesia, the most common would be Muslim. 

So the answer is likely mosques. However, some families might also pray at home. But the question is about gathering to pray together, which could be in either place. But the user wants a single answer. Maybe the answer is mosques. Let me confirm with some sources. In Indonesia, mosques are the main places for communal prayers, and families might gather there for Friday prayers or other occasions. However, daily prayers are often done at home. But the question is about gathering to pray together, which could be either. 

Wait, the user might be looking for the primary place. Since the majority are Muslim, the answer would be mosques. But I need to be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the answer is homes. Let me think again. In many cultures, families pray together at home. However, for communal prayers, they go to the mosque. The question is a bit ambiguous. But since it's about families gathering, maybe the home is the primary place. However, in some cases, like during Ramadan, they might go to the mosque for Taraweeh prayers. 

But the question doesn't specify the type of prayer. So the safest answer is that families gather to pray together at home",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What do people from Indonesia eat in Eid ul Fitr?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what people in Indonesia eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me start by recalling what Eid ul Fitr is. It's the Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. So, during this time, people celebrate with feasts and specific foods.

Now, Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country, so they would have similar traditions to other Muslim countries but with their own local twists. I remember that in many Muslim countries, traditional dishes for Eid include sweets and pastries. For example, in the Middle East, they have baklava, and in India, there's sheer khurma. But Indonesia has its own cuisine.

I think one common dish is ""kue lebaran,"" which are special cakes or cookies made for Eid. There are different types, like kue lapis (layered cake), kue cubit (a type of pancake), and kue talam (batter cake). These are often made with ingredients like coconut, palm sugar, and rice flour. Also, since it's a festive time, they might have more meat dishes, like fried chicken or beef, and maybe some traditional soups. Another thing I remember is ""papeda,"" which is a sago-based dish, but I'm not sure if that's specifically for Eid. Also, there's ""nasi kuning"" (yellow rice) which is often served during celebrations. Maybe they also have traditional drinks like ""sirsak"" (from the soursop fruit) or ""es teh manis"" (sweet iced tea). But I should focus on the main dishes. I think the key ones are the kue lebaran varieties, maybe some meat dishes, and rice-based meals. I should check if there are any specific dishes that are uniquely Indonesian for Eid. Oh, and ""kolak"" is a dessert made with sweet potato, coconut milk, and palm sugar, which might be eaten during Eid as well. But I need to confirm if these are indeed part of the Eid celebrations. Also, considering the answer needs to be a list in JSON format, I should make sure to list the main items without examples. So, the answer would include kue lebaran (various types), nasi kuning, meat dishes like fried chicken or beef, and maybe kolak as a dessert. I should avoid including items that are not specifically for Eid unless they are common. Let me structure this into a list without examples",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about sports that parents and children commonly play together in Indonesia. I need to figure out which sports are popular there for family activities.

First, I should think about Indonesia's culture and common activities. They have a lot of outdoor activities since the country has many islands and beaches. Maybe something like badminton? It's popular in Southeast Asia. Then there's soccer, which is widely played everywhere. But is it common for families to play soccer together? Maybe, but perhaps more among kids and parents.

Then there's traditional games. Maybe sepak takraw? That's a traditional sport in Indonesia, similar to volleyball but with a rattan ball. But I'm not sure if it's commonly played by families. Another thought: batu loncat (stone skipping) or congklak, but those are more games than sports.

Swimming could be common, especially in coastal areas. Families might go to the beach and swim together. Then there's also cycling, maybe? Or maybe traditional games like gasing (top spinning), but that's more for kids. 

Wait, maybe badminton is a good answer because it's accessible, can be played indoors or outdoors, and families can play together. Also, soccer (sepak bola) is very popular. Maybe also vollyball, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is traditional sports like pencak silat, but that's more martial arts, not sure if parents and kids do it together.

I think the most common ones would be badminton, soccer, and maybe swimming. Let me check if there's any other. Maybe games like ""sepak raga"" which is similar to soccer but more casual. But I think the main ones are badminton and soccer. Also, maybe traditional games like ""kasti"" which is a bat-and-ball game similar to baseball. That's played in Indonesia, and families might play it together.

So compiling this, the answer could include badminton, soccer, and traditional games like kasti or sepak takraw. But I need to be sure. Maybe the most common ones are badminton and soccer. Alternatively, maybe also ""bola kaki"" (soccer) and ""bulu tangkis"" (badminton). Also, swimming is common. But the user wants a list, so I need to pick the most common ones.

{""question"":""What are the required subjects in Indonesia's university entrance exam?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the required subjects for Indonesia's university entrance exam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesia's education system. The main university entrance exam in Indonesia is called the Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri (SNMPTN), which is the National Selection for Admission to State Universities.

From what I remember, the SNMPTN typically includes several subjects depending on the major the student is applying for. For example, science and engineering programs would require subjects like Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Humanities and social sciences might require Mathematics, Indonesian Language, and Social Studies. However, I need to be precise here.

Wait, there's also the Ujian Nasional (UN) which is the National Exam taken by high school students. But the university entrance exam might be different. Let me check. The SNMPTN uses the results of the UN, but maybe the required subjects for the SNMPTN itself are determined by the specific university and program. However, the core subjects usually include Mathematics, Indonesian Language, and English. Then, depending on the major, there are additional subjects. For example, STEM fields might have Physics and Chemistry, while others might have Biology or Social Sciences.

I should verify if there's a standard set of required subjects. The answer might be that the required subjects depend on the major, but the common ones are Mathematics, Indonesian, and English, with additional subjects based on the program. However, the user is asking for the required subjects in the entrance exam, not the UN. So perhaps the SNMPTN has specific subjects for each program. For example, the Science and Technology group might have Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, while the Social and Humanities group has Mathematics, Indonesian, and Social Studies. The Law and Social Science group might have Mathematics, Indonesian, and English. But I need to make sure these are accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the required subjects are standardized across all programs. Wait, no, I think it's program-specific. So the answer would list the common core subjects plus the additional ones based on the chosen major. However, the user might be looking for the standard required subjects regardless of the major. But I'm not sure. I need to confirm.

Looking up, the SNMPTN has different groups: Group A (Science and Technology) includes Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Group B (Social and Humanities) includes Mathematics, Indonesian, and Social Studies. Group C (Law and",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular extracurricular social event is at schools in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian schools and their activities. 

First, extracurricular activities in schools often include sports events, cultural festivals, academic competitions, clubs, and social events. Since the question is about social events specifically, I should focus on those that are more about interaction and community rather than academics or sports.

In many countries, things like proms, homecoming events, or school dances are common, but I'm not sure if Indonesia has similar events. However, Indonesia has a rich cultural heritage, so maybe cultural events are more prominent. For example, school festivals that include performances, food fairs, or traditional games. 

Another possibility is ""Pekan Olahraga dan Seni"" (Porseni), which is a sports and arts week that many schools organize. But that might be more of a combined event rather than purely social. 

Wait, there's also ""Bazar"" or school fairs where students sell items, which could be social. But maybe the most popular is something like ""Hari Jadi Sekolah"" or school anniversary celebrations, which often include various social activities and events.

Alternatively, ""Pramuka"" is a scouting organization in Indonesia, but that's more of a club than a social event. 

I think I've heard that ""Pekan Seni"" (Arts Week) or ""Festival Budaya"" (Cultural Festival) are common. These events often involve performances, exhibitions, and social interactions among students. However, if I need to pick the most popular one, it might be the school's annual cultural festival or something similar, which is a major social event where students participate in various activities, performances, and competitions.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should check if there's a specific term used commonly in Indonesia for such events. Alternatively, maybe it's the ""Olimpiade Siswa"" (Student Olympics), but that's more academic. 

Another angle: in some schools, ""Bimbingan Belajar"" (tutoring sessions) are common, but that's academic. Social events might include charity events, blood donation drives, or community service, but those might not be as popular as others.

Wait, perhaps the ""Pesta Kostum"" (Costume Party) or ""Pesta Sekolah"" (School Party) is something. But",1,,,1,0.25

{""question"":""Who is the most well known and successful entrepreneur in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most well-known and successful entrepreneur in Indonesia is. Let me start by recalling some prominent Indonesian business figures. 

First, there's Bob Sadino, but I think he passed away a few years back. He was known for his role in the Indonesian business scene, maybe in the 90s or early 2000s. Then there's Eka Tjipta Widjaya, the founder of Indofood. Indofood is a big company in Indonesia, right? They make instant noodles and other food products. But I'm not sure if Eka is still the most prominent now.

Another name that comes to mind is Teguh Dwi Laksono, the founder of Traveloka. Traveloka is a major online travel agency in Southeast Asia, and it's been growing a lot, even going public in Singapore. But is he the most well-known? Maybe, but there's also someone from Gojek. 

Gojek was founded by Nadiem Makarim. Gojek started as a motorcycle taxi service but expanded into many other services like food delivery, payments, etc. It's become a unicorn company and is one of the largest in Southeast Asia. Nadiem is quite well-known, especially after Gojek's success. He's also been in the news for his leadership and maybe even his political career, like running for president in Indonesia.

Then there's William Tanuwijaya, the co-founder of Bukalapak, another e-commerce platform. Bukalapak is significant, but I'm not sure if it's as big as Gojek. 

Also, there's Ari Budi Wibowo, the founder of Tokopedia, which is one of the largest e-commerce companies in Indonesia. Tokopedia has had a lot of growth and was even in the news for going public in the US. But again, comparing Tokopedia and Gojek, which one is more prominent? 

Another angle is looking at the sectors. In the tech sector, Gojek and Tokopedia are both big. However, in terms of global recognition, maybe Gojek is more known because of its expansion beyond Indonesia. But in terms of domestic impact, both are significant. 

Nadiem Makarim has also been in the news for his political ambitions, which might increase his visibility. However, Eka Tjipta Widjaya, being a long-standing entrepreneur with a company that",1,,,1,0.5

Okay, the user is asking about the typical probation period for new employees in Indonesia before signing a formal contract. Let me think about this.

First, I remember that labor laws in Indonesia are governed by the Manpower Law (Undang-Undang Ketenagakerjaan) No. 13 of 2003. I think there's a section about probation periods. Let me recall. From what I've studied, the probation period can't exceed three months. But wait, is that the maximum or the typical duration?

Wait, the law states that the probation period is up to three months, but it's not mandatory. Employers and employees can agree on a shorter period. Also, during the probation period, the employee is still under the same labor laws, but termination might be easier for the employer, but with notice.

But the question is about the typical probation period. So even though the maximum is three months, companies might use shorter periods, like one or two months. However, the answer should reflect what's legally allowed, not just common practice. But the user is asking for the typical duration, so maybe the common practice is around one to three months. However, I need to check if there's a standard answer.

Looking up, I see that in practice, the probation period is often between one to three months. However, the legal maximum is three months. So the answer would be that the typical probation period is up to three months, but it can vary. But the user wants a single answer in a list. Since the example given was ""1 month,"" but the actual legal maximum is three months, but the typical might be one to three.

But the question says ""typical"" which implies common practice rather than the legal maximum. However, I need to be accurate. If the law allows up to three months, but companies often use one or two, but there's no standard. However, in some sources, the common probation period in Indonesia is 1-3 months. Therefore, the answer is that the typical probation period is up to three months, but the exact duration is agreed upon by the employer and employee. However, the user wants a specific answer in a list. Since the example given was ""1 month,"" but the actual range is 1-3 months. However, the answer should state the maximum allowed by law, which is three months. But the question is about the typical, not the maximum. So perhaps the answer is that it's usually between",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Who is the most popular sportperson in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular sportsperson in Indonesia is. Let me start by thinking about the sports that are popular there. Indonesia has a lot of people into badminton, because they have a strong presence in international badminton tournaments. Players like Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei are from there, but wait, actually, I think Lin Dan is from China. Maybe I'm mixing up the countries. Let me check that again.

Wait, no, Lin Dan is Chinese, and Lee Chong Wei is Malaysian. So maybe Indonesia's top badminton players? There's someone like Taufik Hidayat, who was a famous Indonesian badminton player. He won the All England Open and was a top player in the early 2000s. But is he still the most popular now? Or are there more recent athletes?

Another sport that's popular in Indonesia is football (soccer). The national team is called the Garuda, and there might be some well-known players. For example, Bambang Pamungkas is a retired footballer who was quite famous. There's also maybe some current players who are popular, like Irfan Bachdim or maybe someone younger. But I'm not sure if they are as popular as the badminton players.

Then there's athletics. There's a sprinter named Lalu Muhammad Zohri, who won a bronze medal at the 2018 Asian Games. He became quite a sensation in Indonesia. His story of coming from a poor background and becoming an Olympian made him very popular. He might be one of the most popular athletes currently.

Also, there's maybe someone from boxing or other sports. But I think the ones I mentioned are the top contenders. Now, considering popularity, it might depend on the time frame. If we're talking about recent years, Zohri might be more popular because of his recent achievements and media coverage. However, Taufik Hidayat might still have a legacy. But since the question is about the most popular now, maybe Zohri is the answer. But I'm not 100% sure. I should verify if there are any other athletes who have more visibility. Maybe someone from the Indonesian national football team who's currently active? Or perhaps a female athlete? I don't recall any female athletes being as prominent in the media as the male ones mentioned. 

Another angle: sometimes, athletes who win medals in the Olympics",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular traditional dessert in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking for the most popular traditional dessert in Indonesia. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall Indonesian desserts. There are several traditional ones like Martabak, Klepon, Pudding, and maybe others. But which one is the most popular?

Martabak is a savory pancake, but sometimes sweet versions exist. Klepon is a sweet rice ball filled with palm sugar and coconut, which is popular. Then there's Pudding, but that might be more of a Western influence. 

Wait, maybe I should consider regional variations. In Java, there's a dessert called ""Puding"" or ""Puding Pisang"" (banana pudding), but I'm not sure if that's the most popular overall. Another possibility is ""Kuih"" which is a general term for various cakes and pastries, but that's more common in Malaysia and Singapore. 

Wait, there's also ""Bubur"" which is a porridge, but that's more of a breakfast item. Then there's ""Es Teler"" which is a shaved ice dessert with various ingredients, but is that considered traditional? 

Alternatively, ""Lemper"" is a traditional Javanese dessert made from glutinous rice, but I'm not sure about its popularity. 

Wait, maybe I should check if there's a consensus on this. From what I remember, Klepon is quite popular, especially during festive seasons. However, I think ""Martabak Manis"" (sweet martabak) might be more commonly known, especially in Jakarta. But is that considered a dessert or more of a street food?

Alternatively, ""Puding"" (pudding) is widely available and might be the most popular. But I'm not certain. Another possibility is ""Bubur Sumsum,"" which is a sweet porridge made from rice flour and coconut milk, often eaten with palm sugar. It's a traditional dessert in Indonesia, especially in Java. 

Hmm, I think Bubur Sumsum is quite popular. Let me confirm. Yes, Bubur Sumsum is a traditional Indonesian dessert made from rice flour, coconut milk, and palm sugar. It's commonly found in markets and street vendors, especially in Java. It might be the most popular one. 

But I should be careful. Another common one is ""Klepon,"" which is a fried rice ball with palm sugar filling. Both are popular. However, considering the answer needs to be one",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What sports event do people from Indonesia passionately support the most in international competitions?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which sports event Indonesians support the most in international competitions. Let me start by thinking about the sports that are popular in Indonesia. I know that badminton is a big one there. They have some top players like Lin Dan and maybe some others. Wait, Lin Dan is Chinese, though. Maybe I should think of Indonesian athletes. There's maybe someone like Taufik Hidayat or Susi Susanti. They've won Olympic medals.

Then there's sepak bola, which is football (soccer). Indonesia has a national team, but I'm not sure how passionate they are about international competitions compared to other sports. Maybe they support the team, but perhaps not as much as in other countries. 

Another sport could be boxing. I remember that Indonesia has had some notable boxers. Or maybe weightlifting? I'm not sure. Then there's also the Asian Games, which Indonesia hosts sometimes. But the question is about international competitions, not just regional ones.

Wait, the key here is which event they are most passionate about. Badminton is a strong contender because Indonesia has a strong presence in the sport internationally. They have their own Grand Prix tournaments, and the national team is competitive. Also, in the Olympics, badminton is a big deal. So when international competitions like the Olympics or the Thomas Cup (badminton) happen, Indonesians might be really into supporting their athletes.

I think the answer is badminton, specifically events like the Thomas Cup or Uber Cup, or the Olympics. But the question asks for the sports event, so maybe the Thomas Cup? Or perhaps just badminton in general. But the user wants the answer as a list, so maybe ""badminton"" is the sport, and the event would be the Thomas Cup or the Olympics. However, the question is about the event they support the most. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Asian Games? Wait, the Asian Games are regional, but they are international. But I think the main one is badminton events. Let me check my facts again. Indonesia has a strong badminton tradition, so they probably support badminton events the most. So the answer would be badminton events like the Thomas Cup, Uber Cup, or the Olympics. But the answer needs to be in a list. Maybe just ""badminton"" as the event? Or the specific event. Hmm, maybe the answer is the Thomas Cup or the Olympics,",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular food in Indonesia among young people?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular food in Indonesia is among young people. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian cuisine. Indonesia has a diverse range of dishes because of its many islands and cultural influences. Traditional dishes like nasi goreng (fried rice), satay (skewered meat), and rendang (spicy meat stew) come to mind. But the question is specifically about what's popular among young people now.

I should consider current trends. Young people might prefer foods that are trendy, maybe influenced by social media or modern adaptations. Street food is quite popular in Indonesia, and things like fried chicken, burgers, or even Western-style fast food might be common. However, there's also a resurgence of interest in traditional foods, but with a twist. For example, modernized versions of traditional dishes or fusion foods.

Another angle is looking at what's commonly sold in malls or cafes frequented by younger crowds. Things like bubble tea, fried noodles, or even desserts like klepon (a traditional sweet) might be popular. But I'm not sure if those are the most popular overall.

I've heard that nasi goreng is a staple and widely eaten, but is it the most popular among youth? Maybe. Also, there's a lot of influence from neighboring countries, like Malaysia and Singapore, so dishes like roti canai or char kway teow might be found, but I'm not sure about their popularity in Indonesia specifically.

Wait, there's also the rise of food delivery apps and social media influencers promoting certain foods. Maybe something like 'bakso' (meatball soup) or 'mie goreng' (fried noodles) are popular. Or perhaps 'sate' in a more modern presentation. Alternatively, Western fast food chains like McDonald's or KFC might have a significant presence, but are they considered the most popular traditional food?

I think I need to check if there are any recent surveys or articles about this. From what I remember, nasi goreng is often cited as a national favorite and is commonly eaten by all age groups, including young people. However, younger people might also be into fusion dishes or trendy street foods. But if I have to pick one, nasi goreng might still be the answer. Alternatively, maybe 'mie goreng' is more popular now. Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: 'soto' (a soup) is popular, but maybe not as much among youth.",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Indonesia's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the key milestones for children's independence from their parents in Indonesian society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian culture and societal norms. 

First, I know that in many Asian cultures, there's a strong emphasis on family and respect for elders. So, maybe the transition to independence is more gradual compared to Western societies. I should consider traditional practices and how they might influence these milestones.

In Indonesia, education is important. So maybe one milestone is completing formal education, like finishing school or university. But I'm not sure if that's the primary marker or if there are other factors.

Another aspect could be marriage. In many cultures, getting married is a significant step towards independence. So perhaps marriage is a key milestone here. But I need to check if that's common in Indonesia. Also, maybe starting a family or having children would be another step, but that might come after marriage.

Economic independence is another possibility. When a child starts working or earning their own income, that's a big step. However, in some cases, parents might support their children even after they start working, so maybe that's not the only factor.

Religious or cultural rites of passage might play a role too. For example, certain ceremonies or rituals that mark a child's transition to adulthood. But I'm not sure about specific ones in Indonesia. The ""Usia Balig"" or coming of age ceremony might be relevant, but I need to confirm if that's a recognized milestone.

Also, moving out of the family home is a common milestone in many societies. In Indonesia, does that happen at a certain age or under specific circumstances? Maybe after finishing education or getting married.

I should also consider societal expectations. In Indonesia, there might be an expectation that children support their parents financially, which could delay full independence. So maybe the milestones are more about taking on responsibilities rather than physical separation.

Putting this together, possible milestones could include completing education, getting married, starting a career, moving out, and perhaps religious or cultural rites of passage. But I need to ensure these are specific to Indonesia. I should verify if ""Usia Balig"" is a recognized milestone or if there are other cultural practices. Also, the role of the extended family might influence these milestones, making them different from Western norms.

I think the main points would be: completing formal education, marriage, starting an independent career, moving out of the family home, and possibly religious rites of passage. But I need to make sure",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, the user is asking at what age children in Indonesia typically become independent from their parents. They want the answer in Arabic numerals, like 12, and the response should be in JSON format with a list.

First, I need to recall or find information about the typical age of independence in Indonesia. I know that in many countries, especially in Southeast Asia, the age can vary. In some places, kids might stay with parents longer, maybe into their late teens or early twenties. But I need to be specific about Indonesia.

I remember that in Indonesia, education is important. Many children might stay with their parents until they finish high school, which is around 17-18 years old. However, some might leave earlier if they start working, but that's not always the case. There's also cultural factors where family support is strong, so some might stay longer. But the typical age when they're considered independent might be around 18-21. However, I need to check if there's a commonly cited age.

Wait, I think in some sources, the average age for independence in Indonesia is around 21. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. In many developing countries, the age can be higher than in Western countries. But I should be careful not to generalize. Maybe the answer is 18, when they finish high school, but some might stay longer. However, the question is about the typical age. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 18. But I need to confirm. Since I can't look it up, I'll go with the common practice. In Indonesia, after high school (SMA) which is up to 18, some might go to college, but others might start working. However, becoming fully independent might take longer. But the question is about when they typically become independent. Maybe the answer is 21, as that's when they might finish university. But again, not all go to university. 

I think the safest answer, based on general knowledge, is that children in Indonesia typically become independent around 18-21. But since the user wants a single number, maybe the average is 18. However, I'm not certain. Alternatively, some sources might say 21. I need to pick the most likely answer. I'll go with 18 as the age when they finish high school, but I'm not entirely sure.

{""question"":""What is the most common form of private education in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most common form of private education in Indonesia. Let me think.

First, I know Indonesia has a mix of public and private schools. Private education there might include various types like international schools, religious schools, or maybe something else. Wait, there's also something called ""sekolah swasta"" which is private schools in Indonesia. But what's the most common?

I remember that in many countries, private schools are often religiously affiliated. In Indonesia, which is a Muslim-majority country, there are a lot of Islamic schools. So maybe Islamic private schools are the most common. But wait, there are also international schools for expatriates, but those might be fewer in number compared to the overall population.

Alternatively, maybe the most common is the private schools that follow the national curriculum but are privately run. But I'm not sure. Let me check some sources in my mind. From what I recall, the majority of private schools in Indonesia are Islamic schools, known as ""madrasah"" for Islamic education, but also private schools that are secular. However, the largest number might be the private schools that are not religious, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the term ""private education"" can include various levels. But the most common form would be the primary and secondary schools. In Indonesia, the private schools that are non-religious might be more common in urban areas, but again, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the most common is the ""sekolah swasta"" which can be either Islamic or secular. However, if I have to pick the most common, I think Islamic private schools are more prevalent because of the religious influence. But I need to be careful here. Let me think again.

In some regions, especially in Java, Islamic schools are widespread. But in other areas, there might be more secular private schools. However, considering the overall population, maybe the most common form is the private schools that follow the national curriculum (like the Indonesian curriculum) but are privately managed. However, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the most common could be the international schools, but those are more for expats. 

Wait, I think the answer is that the most common form of private education in Indonesia is Islamic private schools, which include both madrasah and other Islamic-oriented private schools. But I should confirm. Another thought: in Indonesia, the term ""sekolah swasta"" includes both religious and secular private schools.",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which month is the final exam term usually scheduled at high schools in Indonesia? (Provide Arabic numerals (1~12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which month high schools in Indonesia usually schedule their final exams. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indonesian education system.

First, Indonesia's school year typically starts in July, right? So the academic year might be divided into two semesters. The first semester would be from July to October, and the second semester from November to December, maybe? Wait, but sometimes there might be variations depending on the school or region. However, the main point is the final exams.

Final exams, or Ujian Akhir Sekolah (UAS), are usually held at the end of each semester. So for the first semester, that would be around October or November. But wait, sometimes schools might have a break in between. Let me think. If the school year starts in July, the first semester might end in November, leading to final exams in November. Then the second semester would start in December, and end in May or June, with final exams in June. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the main final exams for the academic year are at the end of the second semester, which would be around June. But I need to confirm. In some countries, like in the US, final exams are in May or June. But Indonesia's school calendar might be different. Let me check my memory. I think in Indonesia, the school year is divided into two semesters: the first semester runs from July to December, and the second from January to June. Wait, that doesn't make sense because December to January is a break. Maybe the first semester is July to October, then a break in November, and the second semester from December to March, then another break, and the final exams might be in June? Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the final exams for the entire school year are in June. Because in Indonesia, the national exam (Ujian Nasional) is usually held in April or May, but that's for the national level. However, the final exams for the school itself (UAS) might be at the end of each semester. If the school year is divided into two semesters, then the first semester exams would be in November, and the second in June. But I'm not certain. Another thought: the Indonesian school year is often from July to June, with a long break in July. So maybe the final exams are in June. That seems plausible. So the answer would be 6 (June).

{""question"":""What symbolic food do people from Indonesia eat on (Lunar) New Year?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the symbolic food that people in Indonesia eat during Lunar New Year. Let me think.

First, I know that different countries have their own traditions for Lunar New Year. For example, in China, they eat dumplings, fish, and other foods with symbolic meanings. But Indonesia has its own unique culture, so the food might be different.

Wait, Indonesia is a diverse country with many ethnic groups. The Chinese-Indonesian community might celebrate Lunar New Year, but I'm not sure if the food is the same as in China. However, there's also the possibility that other indigenous groups in Indonesia have their own traditional foods for New Year celebrations.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific dish that's commonly associated with New Year in Indonesia. Let me recall. I think in some parts of Indonesia, especially in regions with Chinese influence, they might eat certain foods. But I'm not certain. Another angle: in Indonesian culture, certain foods symbolize prosperity or good luck. For example, ""nasi tumpeng"" is a traditional dish, but is that specifically for New Year?

Wait, nasi tumpeng is a cone-shaped rice dish, often served during celebrations, but I'm not sure if it's specifically for Lunar New Year. Maybe other foods like ""kue lapis"" (layered cake) or ""klepon"" (palm sugar balls) are eaten during festivals. However, I need to verify if these are specifically for Lunar New Year or other occasions.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""nasi tumpeng"" because it's a common dish during celebrations, including New Year. But I'm not 100% sure. Another possibility is that the Chinese-Indonesian community might eat similar foods to Chinese traditions, like dumplings or fish, but the question specifies ""symbolic food"" for Indonesia, so maybe it's more about local Indonesian dishes.

I think I need to confirm if there's a specific food that's traditionally eaten during Lunar New Year in Indonesia. If there isn't a widely recognized one, maybe the answer is that they don't have a specific symbolic food, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe ""nasi tumpeng"" is the answer. I'll go with that, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me check my memory again. Yes, nasi tumpeng is often associated with celebrations and might be used during Lunar New Year as a symbol of prosperity and unity. So the answer is",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What do people from Indonesia eat in Ramadan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about what people in Indonesia eat during Ramadan. Let me think about this.

First, I know that during Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, so the main meals would be during iftar (the evening meal that breaks the fast) and suhoor (the pre-dawn meal). Indonesia has a diverse culture with various regional cuisines, so the foods might vary, but there are some common ones.

For iftar, common foods include dates, which are traditional as they're mentioned in the Quran. Then there's nasi goreng (fried rice) and mie goreng (fried noodles), which are popular. Also, satay (skewered meat) is common, maybe with peanut sauce. Bubur ayam, a chicken porridge, is another possibility. For suhoor, people might eat foods that keep them full longer, like porridge, eggs, or bread.

I should also consider traditional Indonesian dishes. Maybe rendang? But that's more of a slow-cooked dish. Maybe ketupat (compressed rice cakes) and lontong (rice cakes with peanut sauce) are eaten during Ramadan. Also, various types of soups like sayur lodeh or sup ayam. Snacks like klepon (palm sugar balls) or bakpia (palm sugar-filled pastries) might be eaten as desserts.

Wait, the user wants a list in JSON format, one answer. But I need to make sure the answer is accurate. I should confirm common Indonesian Ramadan foods. Maybe include both main dishes and snacks. Also, check if there are specific regional variations, but the answer should be general.

So compiling all that, the answer would be a list of typical Indonesian dishes consumed during Ramadan, including iftar and suhoor items. Need to make sure the list is comprehensive but not too specific. Avoid examples like ""dates"" if there's a more general term. Wait, dates are specific but commonly eaten. Maybe include them. Also, check if there's a standard list for Indonesia during Ramadan.

I think the answer should include: dates, nasi goreng, mie goreng, satay, bubur ayam, ketupat, lontong, rendang, sup ayam, sayur lodeh, klepon, bakpia, and maybe porridge or eggs for suhoor. But the user wants one single answer as a list. So I need to list all these items in the",1,,,1,1.0

On average, how far do students typically pursue their education in Indonesia? (e.g., elementary, high school)Provide one single answer as a list form at the end in a JSON format as below. Only the answer should be given with the list, without any examples.

{""question"":""On average, how far do students typically pursue their education in Indonesia? (e.g., elementary, high school)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the average education level pursued by students in Indonesia. First, I need to recall what the typical education structure is there. Indonesia has a national education system that's structured in stages.

Starting with elementary school, which is usually 6 years. Then there's middle school, another 3 years, making it 9 years total for basic education. After that, high school is another 3 years, so 12 years in total. But not all students complete all these levels. 

I remember that in many developing countries, access to education can be limited by factors like economic conditions, geographic location, and cultural factors. In Indonesia, there might be a significant number of students who don't complete high school. 

Looking at enrollment rates, primary education enrollment is usually high, but secondary education rates might be lower. For example, the World Bank or UNESCO might have data on this. From what I've read before, completion rates for secondary education in Indonesia are around 60-70%, but that might vary by region. 

Also, there's the issue of dropouts. Many students might leave school before completing high school due to the need to work or other responsibilities. Additionally, some might not have access to high schools in their areas, especially in rural regions. 

However, there's been an increase in government initiatives to improve education access. Programs like the National Education Development Plan aim to increase enrollment and completion rates. But it's still a challenge. 

So, putting this together, the average might be that students complete up to secondary education (high school), but a significant portion might stop at the junior secondary level (middle school) or even primary. However, the exact average might be around completing secondary education, but with a large portion not finishing high school. 

Wait, but the question is asking for the average. If most students complete up to high school, but some stop earlier, what's the average? Maybe the average is that they complete up to high school, but with a note that many don't. But I need to check if the data supports that. 

Alternatively, maybe the average is that students complete up to the secondary level (high school), but the completion rate is lower. However, I think the typical answer might be that the average is completing up to high school, but not all. However, the exact answer might depend on recent statistics. 

Since I don't have the exact numbers, but based on general knowledge, the answer is likely that",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""What drink is commonly consumed in Indonesia when the weather is cold?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what drink is commonly consumed in Indonesia during cold weather. First, I need to recall or research typical Indonesian beverages. Indonesia has a tropical climate, so cold weather might be during the dry season or in higher elevations. Common drinks there include coffee, tea, and traditional ones like Es Teh Manis (sweet iced tea) or Es Jeruk (iced lemon). But wait, when it's cold, people might prefer something warmer. However, in Indonesia, even in cooler times, iced drinks are popular. Maybe there's a specific drink associated with colder periods.

Wait, maybe during the cooler months, which might be around May to September in some regions, people might drink more hot beverages. But I'm not sure if there's a specific drink. Alternatively, maybe it's still iced tea or coffee. Another thought: in Indonesia, during cold weather, perhaps people consume more hot chocolate or something similar. But I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe it's a traditional herbal drink. Wait, I think Es Teh Manis is a common iced drink, but does it become more popular when it's cold? Or maybe they prefer hot tea. However, in many Southeast Asian countries, iced drinks are popular regardless of the season. Maybe the answer is that there's no specific drink, but the user might be expecting a common one. Alternatively, maybe it's a type of soup or warm beverage. Wait, but the question specifies a drink. Let me check: in Indonesia, during cold weather, people might drink more hot coffee or tea. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""hot tea"" or ""hot coffee."" However, I need to be accurate. Let me think again. Since Indonesia is mostly tropical, cold weather is not common, but when it does occur, people might prefer hot beverages. However, I'm not sure if there's a specific drink. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Es Teh Manis, but that's iced. Maybe the user is mistaken, but I have to answer based on common knowledge. I think the most likely answer is that people consume more hot tea or coffee when it's cold. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe there's a specific local drink.

{""question"":""What do people eat on their birthday in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking what people eat on their birthday in Indonesia. Let me think about this. I know that Indonesia has a diverse culture with many ethnic groups, so there might be various regional dishes. But there might be some common foods that are popular nationwide.

First, I remember that in many Asian countries, certain cakes or pastries are common for birthdays. In Indonesia, maybe they have their own version. I think ""kue ulang tahun"" is a term for birthday cake in Indonesian. That's probably a staple.

Then there's the typical Indonesian food. Nasi goreng, which is fried rice, is a popular dish. Maybe people eat that on special occasions too. Also, satay, which are skewers of grilled meat, are common in Indonesia. They might serve that as part of a birthday meal.

Another thing to consider is the influence of Chinese and Javanese cuisines. For example, lumpia (spring rolls) or bakpao (steamed buns) might be part of the celebration. But I'm not sure if these are specifically for birthdays or just general snacks.

I should also think about desserts. Maybe they have traditional desserts like onde-onde (glutinous rice balls filled with palm sugar) or klepon (similar but with coconut). These are sweet treats that could be served on birthdays.

Wait, but the user wants a list of what people eat, not just desserts. So main dishes and side dishes. Maybe also drinks like es teh manis (sweet iced tea) or other local beverages.

However, I need to make sure these are actually commonly eaten on birthdays. Some sources say that in Indonesia, people might have a birthday cake, nasi goreng, or a special meal with family. But I should check if there are specific dishes that are traditional for birthdays.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is more about the common foods rather than strictly traditional birthday dishes. Since Indonesia is a large country with many regions, the answer might include both traditional and common foods that are eaten on birthdays regardless of the region.

So compiling this, the answer could include items like birthday cake, nasi goreng, satay, fried chicken, and various desserts like onde-onde or klepon. Also, maybe a special drink like es teh manis. But I need to be careful not to include things that aren't specifically associated with birthdays.

{""question"":""What is the most famous public corporation in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most famous public corporation in Indonesia. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall which companies are prominent in Indonesia. Public corporations usually refer to companies listed on the stock exchange.

Indonesia has a few major companies across different sectors. In the banking sector, there's Bank Central Asia (BCA), which is one of the largest banks. Then there's Bank Mandiri, which is state-owned. But maybe in terms of overall fame, there's also companies in other sectors.

In the telecommunications industry, Telkomsel is a big name. It's part of the Telkom Indonesia group. Telkom itself might be considered a major public corporation. Then there's Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas company. But Pertamina might be more known for its role in energy rather than being a public corporation in the stock market sense.

Another sector is consumer goods. There's Unilever Indonesia, which is a subsidiary of Unilever, but I'm not sure if it's a public company. Then there's Indosat, which is a telecommunications company, but I think it's been acquired by other companies like Telkomsel or Singapore's Singtel.

Wait, maybe the most famous one is Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), which is the largest bank by number of branches. However, BCA might be more well-known in terms of private sector banks. But I need to check if they are public corporations.

Alternatively, in the mining sector, there's Freeport-McMoRan, but that's a US-based company with operations in Indonesia. Maybe not as a public corporation in Indonesia itself.

Another possibility is the state-owned enterprises like PLN (the electricity company) or Garuda Indonesia (the national airline). But are they public corporations? PLN is state-owned, but maybe not a public company in the traditional sense.

Wait, the question specifies ""public corporation,"" which usually means a company whose shares are traded on a public stock exchange. So, companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX).

Looking up the largest companies by market capitalization on the IDX, the top ones include:

1. Bank Central Asia (BCA) - a major private bank.
2. Telkom Indonesia - a telecommunications company.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Indonesia attend most frequently.

First, I need to think about the common subjects that students might take extra classes for. In many countries, subjects like math, science, and language are common areas where students seek additional help. But Indonesia might have its own specifics.

I remember that in Indonesia, the national exam, called the UN (Ujian Nasional), is a big deal. Students often prepare for this exam, which covers various subjects. Private tutors or academies might focus on subjects that are part of this exam.

Also, English is a common subject where students might need extra help because it's a required subject in schools and often considered challenging. Then there's mathematics, which is also a core subject and often a point of difficulty for many students.

Another possibility is Islamic studies, but that might be more specific to Islamic schools or in certain regions. However, the question is about the most frequent, so maybe it's a subject that's more universally sought after.

Wait, there's also the preparation for higher education entrance exams, like the SBMPTN (Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri). For that, students might take courses in math, science, and English. So academies offering these subjects could be more common.

Looking up some sources, I recall that in Indonesia, private tutoring centers like ""Bimbel"" (short for bimbingan belajar) are popular. These institutes often focus on subjects that are part of the national curriculum and exams. The most common subjects they cover are mathematics, science (like physics and chemistry), and English.

Between these, math and science are typically the ones where students seek the most help. However, considering the national exam and the entrance exams, it's possible that math is the most frequently attended subject in these academies.

But I should confirm. Maybe there's a specific subject that's more emphasized. For example, in some regions, English might be more prioritized due to its importance in higher education and global communication. However, given the structure of the Indonesian curriculum and the exams, math and science are fundamental and often require extra tutoring.

Wait, maybe the answer is mathematics. Because in many cases, math is considered a challenging subject and a key component of the national exams. So students might attend more math academies.

{""question"":""Which subject is considered the most important for students in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Indonesia. I need to figure out the answer based on available information.

First, I know that in many countries, subjects like mathematics, science, or language are emphasized. But Indonesia has its own education system. Let me think about the Indonesian curriculum. They have subjects like Bahasa Indonesia (the national language), mathematics, science, and religious education. 

I remember that in Indonesia, religious education is mandatory in public schools. However, the question is about what's considered the most important. Sometimes, the subject that's most emphasized in exams or national priorities might be the answer. For example, in some countries, math and science are crucial for STEM fields. But Indonesia has a strong focus on Islamic studies in public schools, but that's only for Muslim students. 

Wait, but the national education system requires all students to take religious education, but the specific religion depends on the student's background. However, the most important subject might be Bahasa Indonesia because it's the national language and essential for communication. Also, mathematics is fundamental in many areas. But I need to check if there's a subject that's universally prioritized more than others. 

Looking at the national exams, like the UN (Ujian Nasional), which subjects are emphasized? From what I recall, subjects like mathematics, Indonesian language, and science are part of the national exams. However, the most important might be Bahasa Indonesia as it's the medium of instruction and a key subject for national identity. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is mathematics, as it's a core subject in many curricula worldwide. But I'm not sure about Indonesia's specific priorities. Some sources might indicate that mathematics is considered crucial for development and higher education. However, I need to be careful here. 

Wait, another angle: in Indonesia, the government has been pushing for STEM education to improve the economy. That might make science and math more important. However, the question is about what is considered the most important, not just what's being promoted. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is religious education, but that's only for students of a particular religion. However, since it's mandatory in public schools, maybe it's considered important. But I think the majority of students are Muslim, so Islamic studies might be the most emphasized, but that's not the case for all.

{""question"":""What type of clothing do middle and high school students wear to school in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what clothing middle and high school students in Indonesia typically wear to school. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian culture and education.

First, Indonesia has a diverse population with various cultural influences, but there's also a national dress code in schools. I remember that in many countries, schools have uniforms, but I'm not sure if Indonesia is the same. Maybe there's a mix between formal and casual wear.

I think in some schools, especially private ones, students might wear uniforms. However, public schools might have more relaxed policies. Let me check my memory. In Indonesia, the national dress code for students is often the ""baju koko"" for boys and ""baju kurung"" for girls, but I'm not certain if that's specifically for schools. Wait, ""baju koko"" is a traditional Indonesian shirt, and ""baju kurung"" is a traditional dress, but maybe they're not commonly worn as school uniforms anymore.

Alternatively, I've heard that in many Indonesian schools, especially in urban areas, students wear Western-style uniforms. For example, boys might wear a white shirt with a tie and trousers, while girls might wear a white shirt with a skirt or trousers. But I'm not sure if that's standard across the country.

Also, considering the climate, Indonesia is tropical, so clothing is usually light and breathable. So uniforms might be made of cotton or other breathable fabrics. Maybe there's a school-specific uniform, but not a national one. Some schools might require a specific color or style, while others allow casual wear as long as it's modest.

Another point is that in some schools, especially Islamic ones, students might wear more traditional attire, like the ""baju koko"" for boys and ""baju kurung"" for girls. However, this might vary by region and the school's religious affiliation.

Wait, but the question is about middle and high school students in general. So maybe the answer is that they wear formal or semi-formal clothing, which could include uniforms or modest Western-style clothing. However, there's no single uniform nationwide, so the answer should reflect that there's variation but a common trend towards modest attire.

I think the answer would be that students typically wear formal or semi-formal clothing, which may include uniforms or modest Western-style attire, depending on the school's policies. But I need to make sure it's accurate. Let me try to recall if there's any official guidelines. I don't think",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, let's see. The user is asking where dependent elderly usually live in Indonesia. First, I need to recall what I know about Indonesia's elderly care systems. Indonesia is a developing country with a growing aging population.

In many countries, elderly people might live with their families, but in Indonesia, there's a cultural emphasis on family care. However, with urbanization and changes in family structures, maybe some live in nursing homes or other facilities. But I should check if there are specific institutions or traditional practices.

I remember that in Indonesia, there are some elderly homes or ""panti jompo"" which are facilities for the elderly. These might be where dependent elderly live if they can't be cared for at home. However, the majority might still live with their families, especially in rural areas where extended families are common. But the question is about dependent elderly, which might imply those who need more care, so maybe they are more likely to be in institutions.

Wait, but I should be careful. Are there other options? Maybe some live in community-based care centers or religious institutions. But the primary answer might be that they live with their families or in elderly homes. However, I need to confirm which is more common.

Looking up some data, but since I can't access the internet, I'll rely on existing knowledge. In many Southeast Asian countries, family care is traditional, but with increasing numbers of elderly and urbanization, institutional care is becoming more common. However, the availability and accessibility of such facilities might be limited, so many still rely on family.

But the question is about ""dependent elderly,"" which are those who require assistance with daily activities. In such cases, they might be more likely to live in nursing homes or elderly care facilities if family support isn't sufficient. However, in Indonesia, the prevalence of such facilities is lower compared to some other countries, so perhaps a mix of family and institutions.

Wait, but the user wants a single answer in a list. The options could be a combination of family homes and elderly homes. So the answer might be that they usually live with their families or in elderly care facilities. But I need to make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that they live with their families, as that's the traditional and more common practice, even for dependent elderly. However, I need to be accurate. Let me think again.

In Indonesia, the concept of ""panti jompo"" exists, but it's not as widespread as in some Western countries. Many elderly",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is Indonesia's most popular family pet?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about Indonesia's most popular family pet. Let me think. I know that in many countries, dogs are common pets, but I'm not sure about Indonesia specifically. Maybe there are cultural factors here. I've heard that in some Southeast Asian countries, cats are also popular, but I need to check if that's the case in Indonesia.

Wait, I should consider local breeds or animals that are commonly kept. There's a breed called the Indonesian Angora, but I think that's a type of cat. Wait, no, the Indonesian Angora is actually a dog breed, right? Or maybe I'm mixing up names. Alternatively, maybe it's the Bali Dog, which is a breed from Indonesia. But are they the most popular?

Also, I've read that in Indonesia, some families might keep smaller animals like birds or rodents, but I'm not certain. However, I think dogs are more commonly kept as pets in many parts of the world, including Indonesia. But I need to confirm if there's a specific breed or type that's more popular than others.

Another angle: looking at pet ownership statistics or surveys. If I can't find specific data, maybe I should go with the most commonly cited answer. I recall that in some sources, dogs are mentioned as the most popular pets in Indonesia, possibly due to their role as companions and guard animals. However, I should be cautious not to assume without evidence. Alternatively, maybe cats are more popular in urban areas, while dogs are more common in rural regions.

Wait, but the question is about family pets. Family pets might be more likely to be dogs because they can be trained and are good with children. However, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check if there's a consensus or a commonly accepted answer. If I can't find specific information, perhaps the safest answer is dogs, but I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe it's cats. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a local animal that's more common, like the Indonesian crested dog or something similar. But I'm not sure. Another thought: in some cultures, certain animals are more prevalent. For example, in some parts of Asia, cats are kept for pest control, but as pets, they might be popular too. 

I think I need to go with the most likely answer based on general knowledge. Since I can't access current data, I'll have to rely on what I know. I think in Indonesia, dogs are considered the",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about coffee chains in the country.

First, I know that Starbucks is a big name globally, and they have a presence in many countries, including Indonesia. They might be popular there too. Then there's Kopi Kenangan, which I think is an Indonesian brand that's been growing quickly. They have a lot of locations, especially in cities like Jakarta and Surabaya. 

Another possibility is Tim Hortons, but I'm not sure how big they are in Indonesia compared to other chains. There's also Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, which is part of the same company as Starbucks, so they might be present too. 

I should check if there are any local brands that have a larger market share. Kopi Kenangan has been expanding rapidly and might have more outlets than Starbucks in Indonesia. However, Starbucks might still be more recognized internationally. 

I should also consider recent trends. Maybe there's a survey or a report that ranks coffee shop popularity in Indonesia. If I can't find specific data, I have to rely on the most common knowledge. 

In some sources, Kopi Kenangan is often mentioned as one of the leading coffee chains in Indonesia, even surpassing Starbucks in terms of number of stores. However, popularity can be subjective, considering both brand recognition and number of locations. 

But the question is about popularity, which might be more about consumer preference and brand presence. Starbucks is a well-known global brand, so they might be more popular in terms of brand recognition, but Kopi Kenangan could be more popular in terms of local market share. 

Wait, I need to verify if there's a clear answer. Some articles mention that Kopi Kenangan is the largest coffee chain in Indonesia by number of stores. However, Starbucks might still be considered more popular due to its international reputation. But the user is asking for the most popular brand in Indonesia, which might lean towards the local brand with more outlets. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another brand. Let me think again. There's also The Coffee Bean, which is part of the same parent company as Starbucks, so they might have a significant presence. But again, Kopi Kenangan's rapid expansion might make them the most popular. 

I think I should go with Kopi Kenangan as the most popular in Indonesia, given their growth and number of locations. However, I need to be cautious because Starbucks might still",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Indonesia. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many countries, backyards have specific features based on culture and climate. Indonesia has a tropical climate, so plants that thrive in heat and humidity are common. Maybe things like fruit trees? Like mango or banana trees. Also, maybe vegetables since many people grow their own food. 

I remember seeing images of Indonesian homes with small gardens. They might have chickens or other small animals for farming. Maybe a pond for water or fish? Also, traditional elements like a ""taman"" which is a garden area. 

Wait, but the question is about the back garden specifically. Are there any specific structures? Maybe a gazebo or a shaded area for sitting. Also, maybe some medicinal plants or herbs used in traditional medicine. 

But I need to be careful not to assume. Let me verify. In Indonesia, many homes have small gardens with fruit trees, vegetables, and sometimes livestock. Ponds are also common for water storage or fish. So combining these, the answer would include fruit trees, vegetable patches, ponds, maybe chickens, and traditional plants. But the user wants one single answer in a list. So perhaps the most common item is fruit trees. Wait, but the question says ""what can typically be found,"" so maybe a list of typical items. But the user wants one answer as a list. Let me check the example again. The example shows a list with one item. Wait, the user says ""provide one single answer as a list form."" So maybe the answer is a single item, but in a list. Wait, the example given in the JSON has ""answer"":[""answer here""], which is a list with one item. So even if there are multiple things, the user wants them all in one list. But maybe the main thing is fruit trees. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination. But I need to make sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that back gardens in Indonesia often have fruit trees, vegetables, and sometimes small livestock. But the user might be looking for the most typical thing. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""fruit trees and vegetables"" as the primary elements. However, I need to check if there's a standard answer.

{""question"":""What is the most famous sports-related movie in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most famous sports-related movie in Indonesia. Let me think about this. I know Indonesia has a rich cinematic history, but sports movies might not be as prominent as other genres. Let me recall any notable Indonesian films related to sports.

There's a movie called ""Laskar Pelangi"" which is about a group of students, but I think that's more about education and friendship rather than sports. Then there's ""Gundala,"" which is a superhero film based on a comic book character, but that's not sports-related either. 

Wait, maybe ""Pencak Silat"" films? Indonesia has a lot of martial arts movies, especially those featuring Pencak Silat, which is a traditional martial art. One of the most famous is ""The Raid: Redemption"" (2011), directed by Gareth Evans. While it's an action film, it's heavily influenced by Indonesian martial arts and features intense fight scenes. However, is it considered a sports-related movie? It's more of an action thriller with martial arts elements. 

Another possibility is ""Sang Pemimpi"" (The Dreamer), which is about a football player. It's based on the true story of Bima Sakti, a footballer who overcame challenges. That might be a sports-related movie. But I'm not sure if it's the most famous. 

I should verify which one is more recognized. ""The Raid"" is internationally known and has a large following, even though it's action. However, if the user is specifically looking for sports, ""Sang Pemimpi"" might be the answer. But I'm not certain. Maybe there's another one. 

Alternatively, ""Laskar Pelangi"" isn't sports, but ""Ketika Cinta Bertasbih"" is a drama. Maybe I'm missing a key film. Let me check my memory again. 

Wait, ""Hantu Jeruk Purut"" is a horror film. No, that's not it. Maybe ""Pengabdi Setan"" but that's horror too. 

I think ""Sang Pemimpi"" is the most likely answer for a sports-related movie. It's about football and based on a real person. However, I'm not 100% certain if there's a more famous one. If ""The Raid"" is considered, even though it's action, maybe it's the most famous. But the user specified",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""What are the family-related holidays in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about family-related holidays in Indonesia. Let me think about the major ones.

First, I know that Indonesia has several public holidays that are tied to family or community events. The most obvious one is Lebaran, which is the end of Ramadan. It's a big family holiday where people visit relatives, and it's a time for togetherness.

Then there's Nyepi, which is a Balinese Hindu holiday. It's a day of silence and reflection, so maybe not as family-oriented as Lebaran, but still a significant cultural event. But I'm not sure if it's considered family-related. Maybe I should check that.

Also, there's Christmas on December 25th, but that's more for the Christian community. However, in Indonesia, which is mostly Muslim, Christmas might not be a widespread family holiday. But some families might celebrate it, so perhaps it's worth mentioning.

Another one is Imlek, the Chinese New Year. Again, it's a family holiday for the Chinese-Indonesian community. But since the question is about Indonesia in general, maybe including it is okay, but I need to confirm if it's recognized as a public holiday.

Wait, the user wants family-related holidays. So maybe I should focus on national holidays that are widely observed. Lebaran (Idul Fitri) is definitely a major one. Then there's Hari Raya Idul Adha, which is another Islamic holiday, but it's more about sacrifice and community, not sure if it's family-focused.

Hari Natal (Christmas) is a public holiday for Christians, but not the majority. Hari Raya Nyepi is a public holiday in Bali, so maybe that's considered. Then there's Hari Kemerdekaan (Independence Day) on August 17th, but that's more of a national holiday, not specifically family.

Wait, maybe the user is looking for holidays that involve family gatherings, not just religious ones. So Idul Fitri (Lebaran) is the main one. Then maybe Hari Raya Nyepi if it's considered family-related. Also, there's the Islamic New Year, but I'm not sure if that's a public holiday.

{""question"":""What is the most common livestock raised in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most common livestock in Indonesia. Let me think. I know that Indonesia has a large population, so they probably raise a lot of animals for food.

First, I should consider the main types of livestock. Cattle are common in many countries for meat and milk. But in Indonesia, maybe they have a lot of buffalo? Or maybe chickens? Wait, chickens are usually more common for eggs and meat. But I've heard that Indonesia has a significant number of water buffalo, especially in rural areas. However, I'm not sure if that's the most common. 

Wait, another angle: the country's geography. Indonesia has many islands, so maybe they raise animals that can adapt to different environments. Pigs are also common in some regions. But I think the answer might be cattle. Or maybe goats? I need to check my knowledge here. 

Wait, I remember that in Southeast Asia, poultry like chickens are very common because they can be raised in smaller spaces and provide both eggs and meat. But I think the most common might be cattle. However, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

Looking up in my memory, Indonesia's main livestock includes cattle, buffalo, goats, pigs, and poultry. But which is the most common? I think the answer is cattle. Or maybe buffalo? Wait, in some sources, buffalo are more common for plowing fields and milk. But for meat production, cattle might be more prevalent. Alternatively, maybe the answer is chickens. 

Wait, I think the most common livestock in terms of numbers would be poultry, especially chickens. Because they are raised in large numbers for eggs and meat. However, I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to recall: in Indonesia, the main livestock by number are probably chickens, followed by cattle, buffalo, goats, and pigs. So the answer might be chickens. 

Alternatively, maybe cattle are more common. Hmm. I need to make sure. Maybe looking at the total numbers. According to some data, Indonesia has a large number of poultry, but cattle are also significant. However, the most common could be cattle. Wait, I think the answer is cattle. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is buffalo.

{""question"":""How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Indonesia? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indonesian education system. Middle school in Indonesia is typically referred to as SMP (Sekolah Menengah Pertama), which is the second stage of compulsory education, following elementary school (SD) and preceding high school (SMA).

First, I should consider the standard curriculum for SMP. In many countries, middle school curricula include subjects like mathematics, science, language, social studies, physical education, and maybe some arts or technology. But Indonesia might have its own specific structure.

I remember that the Indonesian curriculum, especially under the K-13 (Kurikulum 2013) which was implemented around 2013, emphasizes a more comprehensive and balanced approach. The subjects might be grouped into different categories such as core subjects, local subjects, and others.

Let me think about the core subjects. Typically, these would include:

1. Indonesian Language (Bahasa Indonesia)
2. Mathematics (Matematika)
3. Science (Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam - IPA)
4. Social Studies (Ilmu Pengetahuan Sosial - IPS)
5. English (Bahasa Inggris)
6. Religious Education (Pendidikan Agama)
7. Civic Education (Pendidikan Pancasila dan Kewarganegaraan - PPKN)
8. Physical Education (Pendidikan Jasmani, Olahraga, dan Kesehatan - PJOK)
9. Art and Culture (Seni Budaya)
10. Information and Communication Technology (Tik)
11. Life Skills (Keterampilan Hidup)
12. Practical Work (Kerja Praktik)

Wait, but some of these might be combined or have different names. Also, there might be variations depending on the region or school. For example, some schools might offer additional subjects like music, drama, or more specialized science topics. However, the national curriculum would have a standard set of subjects that all schools are required to teach.

I should verify if there's a standard number. I recall that in some sources, the number of subjects in SMP is around 12 to 15, but I need to be precise. Let me try to list them again based on the K-13 curriculum:

{""question"":""What is the most popular children's song in Indonesia that families sing together?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular children's song in Indonesia that families sing together. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian children's songs. I know that Indonesia has a rich cultural heritage, so there might be traditional songs that are commonly sung.

First, I should think about well-known Indonesian nursery rhymes or lullabies. One that comes to mind is ""Bunda"" which means ""Mom"" in Indonesian. It's a simple song that children might learn early on, and it's about expressing love and affection towards their mother. Another possibility is ""Kakak Tua"" which translates to ""Older Brother,"" but I'm not sure how popular that is compared to others.

Wait, there's also ""Jalan-Jalan"" which is similar to the English ""Wheels on the Bus."" It's a song that's often used to teach children about different things they see while traveling, like the wheels of a bus, the horns, etc. That might be a candidate. But is it the most popular?

I should also consider if there are any traditional songs that are passed down through generations. For example, ""Sindur"" is a traditional Javanese song, but I'm not sure if it's considered a children's song. Another thought is ""Anak Ayam"" which is a counting song similar to ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"" in English. It's about baby chickens and their mother, and it's interactive, which makes it suitable for children.

Wait, ""Anak Ayam"" might be more of a traditional song that's commonly sung in Indonesia. Let me verify. Yes, ""Anak Ayam"" is a well-known Indonesian children's song. The lyrics involve counting the number of baby chickens, and it's often used in schools and at home. It's simple, repetitive, and educational, which makes it popular among families.

Alternatively, there's ""Bintang Kejora"" which is the Indonesian version of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."" That's definitely a classic, but I'm not sure if it's the most popular in terms of family singing. It's more of a lullaby, but maybe not as interactive as ""Anak Ayam.""

Another possibility is ""Kupu-Kupu"" which is about butterflies. However, I think ""Anak Ayam"" is more widely recognized. Also, considering that ""Anak Ayam"" is often used in educational settings for teaching numbers and counting,",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""Which writers are commonly studied in literature class in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which writers are commonly studied in Indonesian literature classes. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian literature. Indonesia has a rich literary tradition, both in indigenous languages and in Indonesian itself. Since the question is about literature classes in Indonesia, I should focus on authors who are part of the standard curriculum there.

First, I know that there are classic Indonesian authors who are often taught. For example, Sapardi Djoko Damono comes to mind; he's known for his poetry. Then there's Pramoedya Ananta Toer, who is a significant figure in Indonesian literature, especially with his Buru Quartet. He's definitely a key author.

Other names that might be included are Chairil Anwar, a prominent poet from the 1940s and 1950s. Then there's Sitor Situmorang, another important poet. Maybe also Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, who was a writer and academic. 

I should also consider contemporary writers, but I'm not sure if they're included in the standard curriculum. However, the question is about ""commonly studied,"" which might lean more towards classic authors. 

Wait, what about the traditional epics? The Ramayana and Mahabharata are part of Indonesian culture, but they are Indian epics. However, there are Indonesian adaptations, like the Kakawin Ramayana. But the question is about writers, so maybe not the epics themselves but authors who wrote in Indonesian literature.

Also, there might be writers from the colonial period. For example, Tan Malaka, but he's more of a political figure. Or maybe someone like Idrus, who wrote novels. 

I think the answer should include the most well-known authors in Indonesian literature that are taught in schools. So compiling a list: Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Sapardi Djoko Damono, Chairil Anwar, Sitor Situmorang, Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, maybe also Mochtar Lubis. Are there any female authors commonly studied? Maybe Ida Bagus Mantra, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, someone like Rendra, a playwright. However, I need to be cautious not to include names that aren't typically part of the standard curriculum.

To confirm, I can think of the Indonesian National Education curriculum. They often include authors from the 20th century, especially those involved in the struggle for independence",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a food that children in Indonesia typically dislike but the elderly enjoy. Hmm, first, I need to think about Indonesian cuisine and which dishes might be considered less appealing to kids but more so for older people.

So, Indonesian food has a lot of spices and flavors. Kids might not like very spicy or strongly flavored foods. Let me think of some examples. There's ""sambal,"" which is a spicy chili paste. But sambal is used in many dishes, and maybe children avoid it because of the heat. But is it something that the elderly specifically enjoy? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the answer they're looking for.

Another possibility is ""ikan asin"" or salted fish. Salted fish is quite strong in taste and smell. Children might find it too salty or pungent, while the elderly, who have developed a taste for it over time, might prefer it. I've heard that in some cultures, older people have a higher tolerance for strong flavors.

Wait, there's also ""kerak telor,"" which is a savory egg cake. But I'm not sure if that's disliked by kids. Maybe not. Another thought: ""lontong"" or ""bakso"" are more common and liked by all ages. What about ""sayur lodeh,"" which is a coconut milk-based vegetable stew with spices? It's rich and maybe too heavy for kids, but the elderly might enjoy it.

Wait, there's a dish called ""teri"" which is dried anchovies. They are very salty and strong. Kids might not like the taste, but the elderly might consume them as a snack or in dishes like ""teri medok"" (a type of snack). That could be a possibility. But I should verify if that's a common example.

Alternatively, ""kacang tanah"" (peanuts) are usually liked by kids, but maybe salted or spiced versions? Not sure. Another angle: fermented foods. ""Tahu pong"" is a fermented tofu dish. It has a strong smell and taste. Kids might avoid it due to the odor, while older people might eat it for its umami flavor.

I think ""tahu pong"" is a good candidate. Let me check some sources. From what I recall, tahu pong is a traditional Indonesian food made from fermented tofu, and it's known for its strong smell. Children might not like it because of",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What do people look forward to the most at university festivals in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people look forward to the most at university festivals in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian university festivals. 

First, I know that in many countries, university festivals are a mix of cultural, academic, and social events. But Indonesia has its own unique aspects. Since Indonesia is a diverse country with many ethnic groups and traditions, maybe the festivals incorporate local culture. 

I remember that in Indonesia, there are often cultural performances, traditional dances, and music. So maybe people look forward to those. Also, food is a big part of any festival there. Street food vendors often set up stalls, so maybe the food is a highlight.

Another aspect could be competitions or contests. Like, maybe there are academic competitions, debates, or sports events. But I'm not sure if those are the main attractions. Alternatively, there might be exhibitions or art shows where students display their work.

I should also consider the social aspect. University festivals are times when students can socialize, meet new people, and have fun. So maybe the social interactions and networking opportunities are important. 

Wait, but the question is about what people look forward to the most. So maybe the top things are the cultural performances, food, and social events. But I need to make sure. Are there any specific events unique to Indonesian universities? For example, maybe there's a focus on traditional games or specific local customs during the festivals.

Also, considering the academic environment, perhaps there are guest lectures or workshops. However, those might be more niche. The main attractions are likely the ones that are more entertaining and engaging for a broader audience.

Putting it all together, the most anticipated aspects would probably be cultural performances, food, and social activities. But I need to check if there's a primary focus. Maybe the food is the main draw because it's a shared experience and a big part of Indonesian culture. Alternatively, the cultural shows might be more prominent.

I think the answer is that people look forward to the cultural performances and traditional food the most. But to confirm, I should consider that in many festivals around the world, food and entertainment are the top draws. In Indonesia's context, traditional performances like wayang kulit (shadow puppetry), dance troupes, and local cuisine stalls would be significant. So combining these, the answer would be cultural performances and traditional food. However, the question asks for one single answer in a list. Maybe the top one is the cultural performances, or maybe it",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""Where do high school students in Indonesia usually go after dinner?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking where high school students in Indonesia usually go after dinner. First, I need to think about typical activities that students might do after eating.

In many countries, after dinner, students might study, relax, or spend time with family. But Indonesia has its own cultural context. High school students there might have different routines. Let me consider possible options.

First, studying is common. Many students have homework or study sessions. But maybe they also have family time. In some cultures, family dinners are important, but the question is after dinner. So maybe they go to their rooms to study, or maybe they hang out with friends. However, after dinner, depending on the time, some might go to local spots like a park or a café. But wait, high school students might have curfews or be monitored by parents, so going out might not be common. 

Another angle: in Indonesia, after dinner, especially in the evenings, some students might attend religious activities, like praying or going to a mosque. But that's more specific to certain regions or families. Alternatively, they might use their time for hobbies, like playing games, watching TV, or using social media. 

Also, considering the education system, some students might attend private tutoring or study groups after dinner. But I'm not sure if that's the most common. 

Wait, the question is about where they go, not what they do. So places, not activities. So possible places could be home (their room), study groups at a friend's house, or maybe local community centers. But I think the most common would be staying home, maybe in their room, or with family. 

Alternatively, if they have time, they might go to a park or a public place, but that might depend on the city. However, considering safety and parental supervision, it's more likely they stay home. 

Another thought: in Indonesia, after dinner, some families might gather for some time, but students might go to their rooms to study. So the answer could be home (specifically their room) or study groups. But the question is about where they ""go,"" which might imply leaving home. 

But maybe the most accurate answer is that they go home, but that's redundant. Wait, the question is after dinner, so they might be at home already. So perhaps the answer is that they stay home, maybe in their room, or go to study with friends. 

Alternatively, maybe some",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What do people in Indonesia traditionally eat on Christmas Day?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about traditional foods Indonesians eat on Christmas Day. First, I need to recall what I know about Indonesian Christmas traditions.

I remember that Indonesia is predominantly Muslim, so Christmas isn't a public holiday there. However, there are Christian communities, especially in areas like Jakarta, Bandung, or North Sulawesi. So, maybe they have some Christmas traditions, but not as widespread as in Christian countries.

Now, the food part. In many countries, Christmas meals include things like roast turkey, ham, or specific desserts. But Indonesia has its own cuisine. Maybe they have a version of a Christmas cake or something similar. I think there's a traditional Indonesian cake called 'kue kastengel' or 'kue pancong', but I'm not sure if those are specifically for Christmas.

Wait, another thought: in some parts of Indonesia, especially among the Chinese-Indonesian community, they might have dishes like 'nasi goreng' or 'lumpia' (spring rolls). But is that specific to Christmas? Or is it more general?

Also, maybe they have a Christmas cake similar to the Western version but with local ingredients. For example, using pandan leaves or coconut. Alternatively, 'roti tawar' (white bread) might be used in some dishes.

I should verify if there's a specific traditional dish. However, since Christmas isn't widely celebrated, the food might not be distinct from other occasions. Maybe they just have a festive meal with local dishes. But the user is asking for traditional foods specifically on Christmas Day. 

Alternatively, perhaps they have a version of 'kerak telor' (egg cake), which is a traditional Indonesian dessert. Or maybe 'srikaya', which is a sweet made from coconut milk and egg yolks. But again, is that tied to Christmas?

I think the answer might be that there isn't a specific traditional Indonesian Christmas dish, but some communities might prepare a festive meal with local ingredients. However, the user expects an answer, so I need to provide what's commonly known. Maybe the answer is that they eat a variety of local dishes, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, some sources mention that in certain areas, they might have 'kue kastengel' or 'kue pancong' as part of the celebrations. But I'm not 100% sure.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking what food is associated with Halloween in Indonesia. Hmm, Halloween isn't a traditional Indonesian holiday, so I need to think about how Indonesians might celebrate it. They might have adopted some Western traditions, but with local twists.

First, I know that in many countries, Halloween foods are things like pumpkin pies, candy, or spooky-themed treats. But Indonesia has its own cuisine. Maybe they use local ingredients. For example, jack-o'-lanterns are made from pumpkins, but in Indonesia, they might use sweet potatoes or other available vegetables. However, I'm not sure if that's a common practice.

Alternatively, maybe they have specific snacks or desserts that are popular during Halloween events. Sometimes, people make spooky versions of local foods. For instance, they might create ghost-shaped snacks using traditional ingredients like onde-onde (glutinous rice balls filled with palm sugar) or other sweets. But is there a specific food that's commonly associated with Halloween there?

Wait, I should check if there's any traditional Indonesian food that's linked to Halloween. Maybe not directly, but during Halloween parties, they might serve Western-style treats like cookies or candies, but adapted with local flavors. However, the question is about food specifically associated with Halloween in Indonesia. If there's no traditional food, maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific food, but they might use Western foods with local twists.

But I need to be accurate. Let me think again. In some parts of Indonesia, they might have Halloween parties where they serve typical Western Halloween foods, but I don't recall any specific Indonesian dish being linked to Halloween. Perhaps the answer is that there isn't a traditional Indonesian food associated with Halloween, but they might consume general Halloween treats like candy or cookies. However, the user might be expecting a specific answer. Alternatively, maybe they use local ingredients in Halloween decorations, but not food.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a specific dish. Let me think if there's any. Maybe ""tumpeng"" is a traditional dish, but that's more for other celebrations. Or maybe ""klepon"" (palm sugar balls), but I don't think that's linked to Halloween. Alternatively, during Halloween, they might have ""kue kacang"" (peanut cookies) or other snacks, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific food associated with Halloween in Indonesia, as it's not a traditional holiday there",1,,,1,1.0
