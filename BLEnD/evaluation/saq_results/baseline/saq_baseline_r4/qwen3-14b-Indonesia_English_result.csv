{""question"":""What is the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular prenatal education activity for pregnant women in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about prenatal care in Indonesia. 

First, prenatal education typically includes things like attending classes, workshops, or seminars on pregnancy, childbirth, and infant care. In many countries, these classes are often held in hospitals or community centers. But Indonesia has its own cultural context, so maybe there's something specific there.

I remember that in some Southeast Asian countries, traditional practices play a big role. However, prenatal education might also be influenced by government health programs. Indonesia has a national health system, and the Ministry of Health probably promotes certain activities. 

I think there's a program called ""Posyandu,"" which is a community-based health service for mothers and children. Posyandu provides regular check-ups and health education. Maybe prenatal education is part of that. But is that the most popular activity?

Alternatively, maybe attending prenatal classes at hospitals or clinics is more common. These classes might cover topics like nutrition, exercise, labor preparation, and breastfeeding. However, I'm not sure if that's the most popular. 

Another angle: in Indonesia, there's a strong emphasis on family and community support. So maybe group sessions or workshops led by midwives or healthcare professionals are common. 

I should also consider if there are any specific cultural practices or activities unique to Indonesia. For example, certain traditional herbs or rituals, but those might not be considered ""education"" activities. 

Wait, the question is about education activities, so it's more about learning than traditional practices. 

Looking up some sources in my mind, I recall that in Indonesia, antenatal care (ANC) visits are common, but the education part might be integrated into those visits. However, the most popular educational activity could be attending prenatal classes or workshops. 

But I need to be precise. If Posyandu is a community-based program that includes education, maybe that's the answer. However, Posyandu is more about regular check-ups and basic health services, not necessarily structured education classes. 

Alternatively, maybe the most popular is attending prenatal classes provided by hospitals or health centers, which are part of the standard prenatal care. 

I think the answer is that the most popular prenatal education activity is attending prenatal classes or workshops, but I need to confirm. Since I can't look it up, I'll go with the information I have. In many countries, prenatal classes are common, and given Indonesia's",1,,

{""question"":""What soccer teams in Indonesia are famous for their intense rivalry? (e.g. ___ vs ___)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which soccer teams in Indonesia are known for their intense rivalries. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian football. The top league is Liga 1, and there are several prominent clubs.

First, there's Persija Jakarta. I remember they have a big rivalry with PSIS Semarang. Wait, no, maybe that's not the main one. Another one is the Derby Jawa Barat between Persib Bandung and PSM Makassar? No, wait, PSM is from Makassar, which is in Sulawesi. The West Java derby is actually between Persib Bandung and PSMS Medan? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the most famous rivalry is between Persija Jakarta and Persipura Jayapura. They have a strong rivalry, often called the ""Derby of the East and West"" or something like that. Also, there's the derby between Persib Bandung and PERSIS Solo. Or maybe Persib vs. Persija? I think there's a rivalry between those two as well. Wait, but Persija is from Jakarta and Persib is from Bandung, so that's a big city rivalry. But I'm not sure if that's the most intense.

Another one is the rivalry between Arema Malang and Persebaya Surabaya. They are both from East Java, so that's a local derby. That's a significant rivalry. Arema vs. Persebaya is known as the ""Derby Brawijaya"" or something similar. That's probably one of the fiercest in Indonesia.

Also, there's the rivalry between PSIS Semarang and Persipura Jayapura, but I'm not sure. Or maybe PSIS vs. Persija? I think the main ones are Arema vs. Persebaya and Persija vs. Persipura. Wait, but I should check if there are more. There's also the derby between Persib Bandung and PERSIS Solo, but I think that's not as intense as the Arema-Persebaya one.

So, to sum up, the most famous rivalries are:

1. Arema Malang vs. Persebaya Surabaya (East Java derby)
2. Persija Jakarta vs. Persipura Jayapura (maybe called the Jakarta vs. Jayapura rivalry)
3. Persib Bandung vs.",1,,

Okay, so I need to figure out how long, on average, people in Indonesia take to have dinner at a restaurant. The answer should be in hours, with one decimal place. Let me start by thinking about the factors that might influence this.

First, I know that dining times can vary based on cultural norms, the type of restaurant, and the occasion. In some cultures, meals are more rushed, while in others, people take their time. Indonesia is a country with diverse cultures, but there might be some general trends.

I remember that in many Asian countries, dinner might be quicker compared to Western countries where meals can be more leisurely. However, Indonesia has a mix of both. For example, in urban areas like Jakarta or Surabaya, people might be busier, leading to shorter dining times. But in more relaxed settings or family-run restaurants, people might stay longer.

Also, the type of restaurant matters. Fast food places would naturally have shorter meal times, maybe around 30 minutes to an hour. On the other hand, sit-down restaurants or places that serve traditional dishes like nasi padang or rendang might take longer, maybe 1.5 to 2 hours. However, this is speculative.

I should consider if there are any studies or surveys on this. I don't have access to specific data, but maybe I can infer based on similar countries. For example, in Thailand, average dinner times might be around 1.5 hours, but that's just a guess. In the US, it's often 1-2 hours. Maybe Indonesia is similar to other Southeast Asian countries.

Another angle: considering that in Indonesia, dinner is usually eaten around 6-7 PM, and people might not stay too late. If they have a family meal, maybe they spend 1.5 hours. But if it's a casual dinner with friends, perhaps 1 hour. However, this is still not concrete.

I should also think about the possibility of variations between different regions. In rural areas, maybe meals are more communal and take longer, while in cities, people are more time-constrained. But without specific data, it's hard to say.

Since the question asks for an average, I might have to make an educated guess. If I consider that in many parts of Southeast Asia, dining out is often not too lengthy, maybe averaging around 1.5 hours. But I need to check if that's reasonable. Alternatively, maybe it's less. If people have dinner",1,,

{""question"":""Which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Indonesia. Let me start by thinking about the common trends in international education. Indonesia has a lot of students going overseas for higher education. I remember reading that many Indonesian students choose to study in countries like Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United States. 

Now, what fields are popular? Engineering comes to mind because it's a common choice in many countries. But wait, I've also heard that business and management are popular, maybe because of the economic opportunities. Then there's medicine, but I think studying medicine abroad is quite competitive and expensive, so maybe not the most common.

Another angle: some professions might be more in demand in Indonesia. For example, information technology or computer science might be growing fields. However, I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe education itself, like teaching or education degrees, but that might be less common.

Wait, I should check some sources. From what I recall, in recent years, engineering, business, and information technology are top choices. But which one is the most common? I think engineering might be the top. However, another thought: some reports mention that Indonesian students often pursue degrees in hospitality and tourism, especially in countries like Australia and the UK. But is that the most common?

Alternatively, maybe the answer is medicine. But I think the number of students studying medicine abroad might be lower due to the high costs and the need for specific qualifications. Let me think again. In some rankings, business administration is a top choice. But I'm not certain. 

Another approach: looking at the number of Indonesian students in various countries. For example, in Australia, which is a popular destination, the most common courses might be business, engineering, and IT. Similarly, in the US, maybe engineering and business. But which one is the most common overall? 

I think the answer is likely engineering. However, I need to be careful. Maybe the most common is actually business or management. Alternatively, some sources might say that the most common is information technology. 

Wait, I found a source once that mentioned that the top fields are engineering, business, and information technology, with engineering being the most common. But I'm not 100% sure. Another possibility is that it's medicine, but I think that's less common. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is education, like teaching degrees. But I think that's not as common as engineering.",1,,

{""question"":""Where do families gather to pray together in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking where families in Indonesia gather to pray together. Let me think about this. Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country, so the primary place for prayer would be a mosque. However, there might be other places too, like homes or community centers, especially for different religious groups. But since the question is about families gathering, mosques are the most common. Wait, but not all families are Muslim. Indonesia has other religions like Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. So, for non-Muslim families, they might gather in churches, temples, or other places of worship. However, the question doesn't specify a particular religion, so the answer might need to include all possible places. But the user might be looking for the most common or primary place, which is the mosque for the majority. Alternatively, maybe the answer should mention multiple places. But the user wants a single answer in a list. Let me check if there's a standard answer. In Indonesia, the main places of worship are mosques for Muslims, churches for Christians, temples for Hindus and Buddhists, and there are also traditional places. However, the question is about families gathering to pray together. So, the answer should list all possible places where families of different religions gather. But the user might be expecting the most common one. Wait, the user says ""families gather to pray together"" without specifying religion. So, the answer should include all possible places. But the example given in the JSON format is a list with one answer. Wait, the user says ""Provide one single answer as a list form"". So, maybe the answer is a list with multiple items. But the initial instruction says ""one single answer as a list form"". Hmm, maybe the answer is a list with multiple entries, like [""mosques"", ""churches"", ""temples"", ""community centers""]. However, I need to make sure. Let me confirm. Indonesia's main religions are Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Each has their own places of worship. So, families would gather in those respective places. Therefore, the answer should include all of them. But the user might be looking for the primary one, which is mosques. However, the question is general, not specific to a religion. Therefore, the answer should include all the places of worship. So, the answer list would be [""mosques"", ""churches"", ""temples"", ""community centers"", ""homes""]. Wait, but homes",1,,

{""question"":""What is the duration (in hours) of a typical workday in Indonesia? (Provide Arabic numerals (0~24) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the typical workday duration in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about work hours in different countries. In many countries, the standard workday is around 8 hours, but it can vary. For example, in some European countries, they might have shorter days with more breaks, while in others, it might be longer.

Indonesia is in Southeast Asia. I remember that in some Southeast Asian countries, the workday can be longer than 8 hours, especially in certain industries. However, I should check if there's an official standard. Indonesia has labor laws, so maybe the government sets a standard workweek. Let me think: the International Labour Organization (ILO) sets guidelines, but countries can have their own regulations.

From what I recall, Indonesia's labor law might stipulate a maximum number of working hours per day. I think the standard is 8 hours a day, but sometimes employees might work more, especially in sectors like manufacturing or services. However, the question is about the typical workday, not the maximum allowed. 

Wait, but maybe in practice, people work more than 8 hours. For example, in some places, the workday might be 9 or even 10 hours. However, if the official standard is 8 hours, then the typical might be around that. But I need to be careful here. Let me try to remember if there are any specific sources. 

I think in Indonesia, the standard workday is 8 hours per day, 5 days a week, totaling 40 hours. That's similar to many other countries. However, there might be exceptions for certain industries or roles. But the question is about a typical workday, so the answer would likely be 8 hours. 

Wait, but maybe in some sectors, like in the informal economy or certain companies, people work longer hours. However, the official standard is 8 hours. So unless the question is referring to actual practice rather than the legal standard, the answer would be 8. But the question says ""typical,"" which could be either. 

I should verify. A quick search in my memory: Indonesia's Labor Law No. 13 of 2003 states that the maximum working hours per day is 8 hours, and the workweek is 40 hours. So the standard is 8 hours per day. However, in reality, some workers might work longer, but the typical or standard",1,,

{""question"":""What do people from Indonesia eat in Eid ul Fitr?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what people in Indonesia eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me start by recalling what Eid ul Fitr is. It's the Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. So, during this time, people celebrate with special foods.

Now, Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country, so they definitely have their own traditional dishes for this occasion. I need to think about Indonesian cuisine and any specific dishes associated with Eid. I remember that in many Muslim countries, sweets and pastries are common during Eid. For example, in Indonesia, there's a sweet called ""Klepon"" which are rice flour balls filled with palm sugar and grated coconut, often fried. Another possibility is ""Lemper,"" which is a type of rice cake wrapped in banana leaves and filled with peanuts and sugar. There's also ""Pisang goreng,"" which are fried bananas, sometimes with sugar. 

Wait, but maybe there are more specific dishes. I should check if there's a particular dish that's more traditional for Eid in Indonesia. I think ""Kuih"" is a general term for various sweet pastries in Southeast Asia, and Indonesia has its own versions. Also, ""Bubur"" is a type of porridge, but I'm not sure if that's specific to Eid. 

Another thought: during Eid, people might also have traditional snacks like ""Bakpia,"" which are sweet pastries filled with mashed lotus seeds. But I'm not entirely certain if that's specific to Indonesia or other regions. Also, ""Pecel Lele"" is a dish with fried catfish and a spicy peanut sauce, but that's more of a regular dish, not specifically for Eid. 

Wait, maybe the most common ones are Klepon, Lemper, and Pisang goreng. Also, there's ""Lumpia,"" which are spring rolls, but they might be more common in other contexts. I should focus on the sweets and traditional snacks that are specifically eaten during Eid. 

I think the key is to list the most traditional Indonesian foods associated with Eid ul Fitr. So, the answer should include items like Klepon, Lemper, Pisang goreng, and maybe others like ""Kuih"" or ""Bubur"" if they are specific. However, I need to be accurate. Let me confirm: Klepon is definitely a popular sweet during Eid. Lemper is another one. Also, ""Lontong",1,,

{""question"":""What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian culture and common activities.

First, Indonesia is an archipelago with a lot of beaches, so water sports might be popular. Maybe something like swimming or snorkeling? But those might be more individual or require specific equipment. Then there's badminton, which is pretty popular in Indonesia. I know that many people play badminton, and it's a common sport in schools and communities. It's possible that families play it together.

Another thought: traditional games. Indonesia has various traditional games that might be played by families. For example, sepak takraw, which is a traditional sport similar to volleyball but using the feet. But I'm not sure if that's commonly played by parents and kids together.

Then there's soccer (football), which is a huge sport globally and in Indonesia too. Kids and parents might play soccer together in local parks or fields. It's a team sport that can involve multiple people, so that's a possibility.

Also, maybe outdoor games like catch, tag, or simple running games. But those are more general and not specific to Indonesia. What about martial arts? Some families might practice martial arts like pencak silat together, but I'm not certain if that's common for parents and children to do together.

Another angle: festivals and community events. During certain times, there might be traditional games or sports that families participate in. For example, during Lebaran or other holidays, maybe they have specific activities. But I'm not sure about the exact sports.

I should also consider the availability of sports facilities. In urban areas, maybe more access to sports like badminton or soccer. In rural areas, maybe more traditional or outdoor games. But the question is about common sports, so likely the ones that are widely accessible.

From what I remember, badminton is very popular in Indonesia, and it's a sport that can be played by people of all ages. So parents and children might play badminton together. Soccer is also a big one, as it's a common sport in schools and communities. Maybe also table tennis, but I'm not as sure about that.

Wait, there's also a traditional game called congklak, which is a strategy board game, but that's more of a mental game rather than a physical sport. So probably not the answer here.

{""question"":""What are the required subjects in Indonesia's university entrance exam?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the required subjects for Indonesia's university entrance exam. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesia's education system. The main entrance exam is called the Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri (SNMPTN) or the National College Entrance Examination. 

From what I remember, the exam is standardized and tests subjects that are typically covered in high school. The subjects might vary depending on the field of study the student is applying for. For example, students applying to science or engineering programs would have different subjects compared to those applying to humanities or social sciences.

I think the common subjects include Mathematics, Indonesian Language, and English. These are probably mandatory for all applicants. Then, depending on the major, there are additional subjects. For STEM fields, Physics and Chemistry might be required. For social sciences, maybe History or Geography. Law and humanities might require subjects like Civics or Social Studies.

Wait, but I should verify if these are the actual required subjects. Maybe the exam has a core set of subjects that everyone takes, plus optional ones based on their intended major. Let me check. The SNMPTN usually has a core exam with Mathematics, Indonesian, and English. Then, there's a specific subject test based on the major. For example, Science students take Physics and Chemistry, while Social Science students take Social Studies. 

So putting it all together, the required subjects would be the core ones plus the specific ones depending on the major. But the question asks for the required subjects in general. However, the answer might need to list all possible required subjects, including both the core and the major-specific ones. But I need to be careful not to include subjects that are only required for certain majors unless they are universally required. 

Wait, the user might be asking for the subjects that are required regardless of the major. But in reality, the core subjects are required for everyone, and then each major has its own specific subjects. However, the question might be looking for the list of all possible required subjects, including those that are specific to certain majors. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer should list the core subjects (Math, Indonesian, English) and then the major-specific ones. But the user's instruction says to provide a list of required subjects in the entrance exam. So perhaps the answer includes all the subjects that are part of the exam, both core and major-specific. 

I think the correct approach is to list the core subjects as required for all",1,,

{""question"":""What is the most popular stew in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the most popular stew in Indonesia. Let me think. First, I need to recall Indonesian cuisine. Stews are common in many countries, but what's specific to Indonesia?

I know that Indonesia has a variety of soups and stews. There's ""soto,"" which is a type of soup, often with chicken or beef. Then there's ""gado-gado,"" but that's more of a salad with peanut sauce. Maybe ""rendang""? Wait, rendang is a slow-cooked meat dish, often with coconut milk and spices. It's quite popular, especially in West Sumatra. But is it considered a stew?

Another possibility is ""sop buntut,"" which is a beef oxtail stew. It's rich and popular in Indonesia. Then there's ""lodeh,"" which is a coconut milk-based stew with vegetables and sometimes chicken or fish. But which one is the most popular overall?

I think rendang might be the most well-known, even though it's more of a dry curry. However, some sources might refer to it as a stew. Alternatively, ""soto"" is a soup, but maybe the most popular stew would be ""rendang"" or ""sop buntut."" I need to verify which one is more commonly recognized as the top stew. Considering rendang's fame internationally and its preparation method, it's possible that's the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my memory again. Yes, rendang is often highlighted as a national dish, though it's more of a slow-cooked meat dish. However, since the question is about stew, maybe sop buntut is more accurate. Alternatively, ""soto"" is a soup, but not a stew. Hmm, maybe ""lodeh"" is a stew. But I'm not certain. I think the safest answer is rendang, even if it's a bit of a stretch, since it's the most famous Indonesian dish. Alternatively, the user might be looking for ""soto"" but that's a soup. I need to be careful here. Another angle: in Indonesia, ""stew"" might be translated as ""sup"" or ""sop,"" but rendang is a different category. Maybe the answer is ""sop buntut"" as a stew. But I'm not 100% sure. Given that, perhaps the most popular stew is rendang, even if it's not a traditional stew",1,,

{""question"":""What is the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most popular extracurricular social event is in Indonesian schools. Let me start by recalling what extracurricular activities are common there. Indonesia has a diverse culture, so maybe there are both traditional and modern events.

First, I know that school events like cultural festivals or fairs are common in many countries. In Indonesia, there's a big emphasis on cultural heritage, so maybe something like a cultural day or a traditional dance performance. But wait, are those considered social events? They might be more academic or cultural.

Another possibility is sports events. Sports days or competitions are popular in many schools worldwide. But the question specifies social events, which might lean more towards gatherings rather than sports. However, sports events can be social too.

Then there's the school's annual day or carnival. These events often include various activities, games, food stalls, and performances. They're social and bring the community together. In Indonesia, these might be called ""Pekan Olahraga dan Seni"" (Sports and Arts Week) or similar names. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular.

I've also heard about ""Bazar"" or school fairs where students sell handmade items or food. That's a social event where students interact, but is it the most popular?

Wait, maybe ""Pesta Kostum"" or costume parties? Or maybe ""Buka Puasa"" during Ramadan, but that's more religious. However, some schools might have social events during Ramadan, but that might not be the most popular year-round.

Another angle: in Indonesia, there's a tradition of ""Pekan Budaya"" (Culture Week) where students showcase their regional cultures. This could involve performances, food, and exhibitions. That seems like a major event.

But I need to verify if this is the most popular. Alternatively, ""Olimpiade Siswa"" (Student Olympics) might be more academic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps ""Perayaan Hari Sekolah"" (School Anniversary) events, which include various activities. But I'm not certain.

Looking for common terms, maybe ""Pesta Sekolah"" (School Party) or ""Acara Pecel Lele"" (a type of food event, but that's specific). Wait, ""Pecel Lele"" is a dish, so that's not it.

{""question"":""Who is the most well known and successful entrepreneur in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most well-known and successful entrepreneur in Indonesia is. Let me start by recalling some big names from Indonesia. There's Bob Sadino, right? He's a well-known entrepreneur, maybe in the tech or business sector. Wait, but I think there's also someone from the e-commerce space. Oh, maybe William Tanuwijaya, the founder of Tokopedia. Tokopedia is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Indonesia, so that's a big company. Then there's Achmad Zaky, who co-founded Gojek, which started as a motorcycle taxi service and expanded into various services. Both Gojek and Tokopedia are major companies in Indonesia.

But who is more well-known? Maybe it's subjective. However, considering the scale and global recognition, Gojek might be more prominent because they've expanded beyond Indonesia and have a significant presence internationally. But Bob Sadino is also a prominent figure, known for his ventures in real estate and tech. Wait, but Bob Sadino might not be as directly associated with a single large company as the founders of Tokopedia or Gojek. 

Another name that comes to mind is Ferry Suwignyo, the founder of Traveloka, which is a major online travel company. However, I'm not sure if he's as well-known as the others. Then there's Michaelangelo Yudhoyono, the son of former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who co-founded Traveloka. But again, maybe not as prominent as the founders of Gojek or Tokopedia.

Looking at recent news, Gojek has been expanding and has a significant market presence. Their CEO, Nadiem Makarim, is a well-known figure. But the founder is William Tanuwijaya. However, sometimes the CEO gets more media attention. But the question is about the entrepreneur, so the founder might be more relevant. Alternatively, maybe there are other sectors. For example, in the banking sector, there's Budi Hidayat, the founder of Mandiri, but I'm not sure about his prominence.

Wait, Bob Sadino is often cited as one of Indonesia's most successful entrepreneurs, especially in the context of business and real estate. However, his net worth and the scale of his companies might be compared to others. Alternatively, perhaps the answer depends on the criteria: if it's about the most successful in terms of company valuation,",1,,

What is the common dress code for school teachers in Indonesia?Provide one single answer as a list form at the end in a JSON format as below. Only the answer should be given with the list, without any examples.

{""question"":""What is the common dress code for school teachers in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the common dress code for school teachers in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian culture and education. Indonesia has a diverse population with various cultural influences, but there's also a strong emphasis on modesty and respect in professional settings, especially in schools.

Schools in Indonesia are often influenced by both traditional values and modern practices. For teachers, the dress code might be a blend of these. I remember that in many Southeast Asian countries, teachers typically wear formal attire that's modest. For example, in some places, women might wear long skirts or dresses, and men wear shirts and trousers. But I need to be specific to Indonesia.

I should consider the different levels of education. In primary schools, maybe the dress code is more formal compared to higher education? Or maybe it's consistent across all levels. Also, there might be variations between public and private schools. However, the question asks for the common dress code, so it's likely a general standard.

Another point is the influence of Islamic culture, as Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim-majority country. Modest clothing is important, so teachers might avoid revealing clothing. For women, this could mean covered shoulders and knees, perhaps a modest dress or a long skirt with a blouse. Men might wear long pants and a shirt, possibly with a tie or collar.

I should check if there are any official guidelines. In some Indonesian schools, especially those with religious affiliations, the dress code might be stricter. But for general public schools, the common dress code is likely to be formal and modest. For example, women might wear a ""baju koko"" (a long tunic) with a skirt or pants, and men wear a ""batik"" shirt with long pants. However, ""baju koko"" is more traditional for men, but maybe women's attire is similar to Western business attire but with modesty in mind.

Wait, I might be mixing up different terms. Let me think again. In many schools, teachers might wear formal attire such as blouses and skirts or dresses for women, and button-down shirts with trousers or skirts for men. The color might be more subdued, avoiding bright colors, but that's more of a cultural preference. Also, some schools might require uniforms, but if not, the dress code would be formal and modest.

Another angle is that in some regions, traditional attire might be part of the dress code, but I think the common practice is more about modesty rather",1,,

{""question"":""How long is the typical probation period for new employees before signing a formal contract in Indonesia? (e.g., 1 month)."",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the answer to this question about the probation period in Indonesia. I remember that labor laws can vary by country, so I need to focus on Indonesia's regulations.

First, I think Indonesia has specific labor laws that outline employment terms, including probation periods. The main law here is probably the Indonesian Labor Law, also known as the Law on Manpower. Let me recall, I think the probation period is mentioned in this law. 

From what I remember, the probation period is usually up to three months. But wait, I need to be sure. Maybe there are different scenarios depending on the type of contract or the industry. However, the question is about the typical period before signing a formal contract. 

Wait, in some cases, the probation period might be part of the initial contract. So when a new employee starts, they might be on probation for a certain time before the formal contract is signed. But I think in Indonesia, the probation period is typically between 1 to 3 months. However, I need to confirm if there's a standard set by law or if it's more flexible. 

I should check if there's a maximum limit. For example, in some countries, the probation period can't exceed a certain length. If I recall correctly, in Indonesia, the maximum probation period allowed by law is three months. So employers can set it anywhere from a few weeks up to three months, but they can't go beyond that. 

Therefore, the typical probation period would be around 1 to 3 months, but the most common might be 1 month or 3 months. However, the law allows up to three months, so that's the maximum. Since the question asks for the typical period, I think the answer is that it's usually up to three months, but the exact duration can vary depending on the employer and the agreement. However, the law specifies three months as the maximum. 

Wait, but the user is asking for the typical period before signing a formal contract. Maybe the probation period is part of the initial contract. So when you start, you might be on probation for a certain time, and after that, the formal contract is signed. But in some cases, the probation period might be included in the initial contract. 

I think the answer is that the probation period can be up to three months, but the exact length is agreed upon by the employer and employee. However, the typical duration is often one to three months. But since the question",1,,

{""question"":""What eating utensils do people commonly used in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the common eating utensils used in Indonesia. Let me think. I know that in many Southeast Asian countries, people often use chopsticks or spoons. But Indonesia has a mix of cultures, so maybe there's a variety.

First, I remember that in Indonesia, the main utensils are probably the spoon and fork. Wait, but I've heard that some regions might use chopsticks, especially for certain dishes like noodles or rice. However, in everyday meals, like eating rice with curries or stews, people might use a spoon. Also, there's the ""sendok"" which is a spoon, and ""garpu"" for fork. But do they commonly use both together?

Wait, in Indonesia, it's common to use a spoon and fork together for main courses. For example, when eating nasi goreng or other rice dishes with sauce, you might use a fork to push the food and a spoon to scoop. Then, for more specific dishes, like noodles, they might use chopsticks. But is chopstick usage widespread or more regional?

Also, there's the ""tongkat"" which is a skewer, but that's more for specific foods like satay. Then there's the ""sajak"" or ""sajadah"" which is a mat, but that's for eating with hands. Wait, but the question is about utensils, not eating with hands. So maybe the primary utensils are spoon, fork, and chopsticks. But I need to confirm if chopsticks are commonly used in daily meals or just for specific dishes.

Another point: in some parts of Indonesia, especially in Java, people might use a spoon and fork together, while in other regions, they might use chopsticks more. However, the most common utensils overall would be the spoon and fork. Chopsticks might be used in certain contexts but not as universally as in China. So the answer is probably spoon and fork. But I should check if there are others. Maybe the knife? But I don't think knives are commonly used for eating in Indonesia. They might be used for cutting food before eating, but not as part of the eating utensils. So the main ones are spoon, fork, and chopsticks. But I'm not sure about the prevalence of chopsticks. Maybe only for specific foods like noodles. So perhaps the primary utensils are spoon and fork. Alternatively, in some regions, they use their hands for certain dishes, but",1,,

Okay, so the user is asking who the most popular sportsperson in Indonesia is. Let me think about this.

First, I need to consider which sports are popular in Indonesia. Badminton is definitely a big one. Indonesia has produced many world-class badminton players. Then there's football (soccer), which is widely followed. Also, maybe athletes from other sports like weightlifting or boxing.

Now, thinking about specific names. In badminton, there's Lin Dan, but he's from China. Wait, Indonesia has players like Taufik Hidayat, who was very popular in the early 2000s. More recently, maybe someone like Anthony Sinisuka Ginting or Jonatan Christie? But are they as popular as others?

In football, maybe someone like Bambang Pamungkas, who was a key player for the national team. Or maybe more recent stars? However, footballers might not be as popular as badminton players because Indonesia's football team isn't as successful internationally compared to badminton.

Another angle: athletes with international fame. Maybe someone like Rizki Juniansyah in weightlifting? Or maybe a female athlete? But I'm not sure about their popularity levels.

Wait, there's also the case of athletes who have won Olympic medals. For example, in weightlifting, Indonesia has had medalists. But I need to check who exactly. Maybe Eko Yuli Irawan, who won a bronze in weightlifting at the 2016 Olympics. He might be considered popular.

However, considering the overall popularity, badminton players might still be more recognized. Taufik Hidayat was very popular, but he retired a while back. Current players might not have the same level of fame yet. Alternatively, maybe someone from a different sport who has a large following.

Wait, there's also the case of athletes who are not only successful but also have a significant media presence. For example, maybe someone like Andi Matricaria, a weightlifter who won a gold at the 2018 Asian Games. But I'm not certain about his popularity compared to others.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a single most popular sportsperson, but the user is asking for one name. In that case, perhaps the most commonly cited would be Taufik Hidayat, as he was a dominant figure in badminton and had a large following. However, I",1,,

Okay, let's see. The user is asking which sports event Indonesians support the most in international competitions. I need to figure out the answer.

First, I know Indonesia has a lot of athletes in various sports. But which one is the most popular? Maybe I should think about the sports that Indonesia has done well in. For example, badminton comes to mind. They have top players like Lin Dan and maybe others. Wait, Lin Dan is actually from China, but Indonesia has their own stars like Taufik Hidayat or maybe more recent ones. Also, badminton is very popular in Southeast Asia.

Another possibility is sepak bola (soccer). Indonesia has a national team, but I'm not sure if they're as passionate about soccer as other countries. However, in international competitions like the World Cup qualifiers, maybe there's some support. But I think badminton might be more prominent.

Then there's athletics, like running. Indonesia has athletes like Lalu Muhammad Zohri, who has been in the news for sprinting. But I don't know if that's the most supported.

Also, maybe martial arts, like pencak silat, but that's more of a traditional sport. International competitions for that might not be as high-profile.

Looking at the Olympics, Indonesia's participation might be in badminton, weightlifting, or other sports. But the question is about the event they support the most. Since badminton has produced many champions from Indonesia, it's possible that the Thomas Cup or Uber Cup (badminton team events) are the ones they support. Alternatively, the Asian Games, but that's a regional event, not international.

Wait, the question specifies international competitions. So events like the Olympics, World Championships, or specific team events. Badminton World Championships or the Thomas Cup (men's team) and Uber Cup (women's team) are international. Since Indonesia has a strong badminton presence, people might support those events.

I think the answer is badminton events, specifically the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup. But the user wants the answer in a list as a single answer. So maybe just ""badminton"" as the main sport, but the specific events might be the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup. However, the question is about the sports event, not the sport itself. So the most supported events would be the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup. Alternatively, the Badminton World Championships.

{""question"":""What is the most popular fruit in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most popular fruit in Indonesia. Let me think about this. I know Indonesia has a lot of tropical fruits because of its climate. Common ones are mango, durian, rambutan, and maybe pineapple. But which one is the most popular?

I should check some sources. From what I remember, durian is often mentioned as a popular fruit there, even though it's controversial because of its smell. But maybe mango is more commonly consumed? Or perhaps banana? Wait, bananas are a staple in many Asian countries, but are they considered a ""fruit"" in the same way as others?

Wait, another angle: in terms of production and consumption. According to some agricultural data, Indonesia produces a lot of mangoes. But durian is also significant. However, durian is more of a luxury item and might not be as commonly eaten by everyone. On the other hand, mango is widely consumed in various forms—fresh, in desserts, etc. 

Also, considering the cultural aspect. In Indonesia, durian is known as the ""King of Fruits,"" which might indicate its popularity despite the strong odor. However, not everyone likes it. But if we're talking about the most popular, maybe it's durian because of its fame, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is mango because it's more widely eaten by the general population.

I need to verify. Let me think of any reliable sources. Maybe FAO statistics? Or a recent survey. If I can't access that, I'll have to rely on common knowledge. I think in many Southeast Asian countries, durian is highly popular, but in Indonesia, perhaps mango is more common. Wait, but I've heard that durian is very popular in Indonesia, even though it's banned in some places like hotels. However, the question is about popularity, which could be measured by consumption or cultural significance.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is pineapple? Or maybe it's banana. Wait, bananas are a major crop in Indonesia, but I'm not sure if they're considered the most popular fruit in terms of preference. 

Hmm, this is tricky. I think the safest answer based on common knowledge is durian, given its reputation as the ""King of Fruits"" in Indonesia, even though it's divisive. However, if the question is about the most consumed, it might be mango. But without specific data, I have to go with the commonly cited answer. Let me go with dur",1,,

Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular food in Indonesia among young people. Let me think.

First, I know Indonesia has a diverse cuisine with many regional dishes. But the question is specifically about what's popular among the youth. I should consider current trends. Street food is really big there. Things like fried snacks, maybe something like fried tofu or satay? Wait, but those are traditional. Are they still popular with younger folks?

Then there's the rise of fast food chains. McDonald's, KFC, maybe even local fast food places. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular. Also, there's the trend of fusion foods or modern twists on traditional dishes. For example, burger places that use local ingredients.

Another angle: social media influence. Young people might be into foods that are Instagrammable. Maybe colorful dishes like rainbow rice or unique presentations. But I'm not certain if that's the top choice.

Wait, I've heard that nasi goreng (fried rice) is a staple, but is it the most popular among youth? Or maybe something like martabak, which is a type of Indonesian pancake? Or perhaps the popular street food like pisang goreng (fried banana) or bakso (meatballs)?

Wait, I should check if there are any recent trends. Maybe the popularity of 'bakso' has increased among younger people because it's a common street food that's easy to eat on the go. Or maybe 'sate' (skewered meat) is still popular. Alternatively, there's 'nasi lemak' which is a Malaysian dish but popular in Indonesia too. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 'nasi goreng' because it's widely consumed and adaptable. But I'm not sure. Another possibility is 'mie goreng' (fried noodles). Both are common. However, I need to be accurate. Maybe looking at recent surveys or articles about youth preferences in Indonesia.

Wait, I recall that in some surveys, fried foods like fried chicken, fried tofu, and fried rice are popular. But perhaps the most popular is 'nasi goreng' or 'mie goreng' as they are quick and available everywhere. However, I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe 'burger' or 'pizza' from Western fast food chains are popular among the youth. But I think traditional foods are still more popular.

{""question"":""What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Indonesia's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the key milestones for children's independence from their parents in Indonesian society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian culture and societal norms. 

First, in many cultures, including Indonesia, there are certain age-related milestones. For example, when a child starts school, maybe around 6 or 7 years old, that's a big step. But I'm not sure if that's considered independence yet. Then there's the age when they start working, maybe after secondary school. In Indonesia, secondary education usually ends around 15-16, but higher education might take longer. So maybe completing high school is a milestone. 

Another thing could be getting married. In some Indonesian communities, marriage is a significant step towards independence because it often involves leaving the family home. But I should check if that's a common milestone or if it's more about the age when they can legally marry, which is 18 in Indonesia. 

Also, completing education, especially university, might be a key point. After university, many young adults start working, which is a major step towards financial independence. Then, there's moving out of the family home, which is a clear sign of independence. 

I should also consider cultural aspects. In some parts of Indonesia, especially more traditional areas, children might stay with parents longer, but in urban areas, maybe moving out earlier is more common. However, the question is about the key milestones in society as a whole, not just specific regions. 

Other possible milestones: getting a job, starting a family, taking responsibility for their own finances. Maybe the age when they can legally make decisions without parental consent, like 18. Also, completing certain educational levels like high school or university. 

Wait, the question is about independence from parents, so the milestones would be events that signify the child is no longer dependent. So, starting school might not be it, but finishing education, getting a job, moving out, getting married, etc. 

I need to list these in order or as key points. Let me make sure I'm not missing any important ones. Also, cultural practices like coming of age ceremonies? I'm not sure if Indonesia has a specific one like a quinceañera or similar. Maybe not, but there might be local traditions. However, the answer should be general for Indonesian society, not specific regions.

{""question"":""What is a typical festive meal in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about a typical festive meal in Indonesia. Let me think. I know that Indonesia has a lot of diverse cultures and regions, so their festive meals might vary. But there must be some common dishes that are widely recognized during celebrations.

First, I should recall major festivals in Indonesia. There's Eid al-Fitr, which is a big one after Ramadan. Then there's Christmas, especially in areas with significant Christian populations like in North Sulawesi or parts of Java. Also, there's Nyepi, the Balinese New Year, which might have its own traditional foods.

For Eid al-Fitr, I remember that people often eat sweet treats. Maybe something like ""klepon"" or ""lumpia"" which are sweet dumplings. But wait, there's also ""kolak,"" which is a dessert made with coconut milk, palm sugar, and ingredients like jackfruit or bananas. That's a common one during festivals.

Another dish is ""nasi kuning,"" which is yellow rice made with turmeric, often served with chicken or other meats. It's sometimes part of festive meals. Then there's ""sate"" (skewered meat) which is popular during celebrations. Also, ""rendang"" is a slow-cooked meat dish from Minangkabau, but I'm not sure if it's specifically for festivals.

For Christmas, maybe ""puding"" (pudding) and ""kue kering"" (dry cakes) like ""kastengel"" or ""kue lapis"" (layered cake). But the user wants a single answer, so maybe focus on the most common one.

Wait, the user said ""a typical festive meal,"" not necessarily specific to one festival. So perhaps a combination of dishes that are commonly found during various celebrations. But the answer needs to be a list in JSON. The example given in the query shows a list with one answer. Wait, the user says ""provide one single answer as a list form"" but the example has a list with one item. Maybe they want multiple items in the list but the answer is a single list.

{""question"":""At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Indonesia? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about when children in Indonesia become independent from their parents. First, I need to recall what I know about Indonesian culture and societal norms regarding children's independence.

I know that in many countries, the age at which children leave home varies. For example, in some Western countries, it's common for people to leave home around 18-21, but in other cultures, especially in more traditional or collectivist societies, children might stay with their parents longer. Indonesia is a country with a mix of traditional values and modern influences. 

From what I remember, in Indonesia, it's common for children to live with their parents until they get married. Marriage age in Indonesia is typically around late teens to early twenties. So maybe around 20-25 years old? But I should check if there's a more specific age. However, the question is about becoming independent, which might not necessarily be tied to marriage. Some might leave earlier for education or work, but traditionally, the family structure is such that children stay until they're married. 

Wait, but in urban areas, maybe there's a trend towards younger independence. However, the general norm, especially in rural areas, might still be marriage age. The legal marriage age in Indonesia is 19 for women and 21 for men, but in practice, it might be a bit younger in some regions. However, the average age of marriage is around 23-24. So perhaps the typical age when children become independent is around 22-24. But I need to be careful here. 

Alternatively, some sources might suggest that the average age is around 21. But I think the key point is that in Indonesia, children typically remain with their parents until they marry, which is usually in the early to mid-twenties. Therefore, the answer would be around 22 or 23. But since the question asks for a specific numeral, I need to pick one. 

I think the most commonly cited average age for marriage in Indonesia is around 22-23 years. However, I should confirm if there's a standard answer. Some sources indicate that the average age for women is 22.5 and for men 25. So maybe 22-25. But since the question is about becoming independent, which is often tied to marriage, the answer would be around 22-25. However, the question might expect a single",1,,

{""question"":""Which month is the final exam term usually scheduled at high schools in Indonesia? (Provide Arabic numerals (1~12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about when the final exams are usually scheduled in Indonesian high schools. They want the answer in Arabic numerals, 1 to 12, so just the month number.

First, I need to recall the typical school calendar in Indonesia. I know that Indonesia's academic year might be structured differently from some other countries. In many countries, final exams are at the end of the academic year, which is usually around June or July. But I should confirm if Indonesia follows a similar pattern.

Wait, Indonesia's school terms might be divided into two semesters. The first semester might end around June, and the second around December. But final exams for the entire year might be at the end of the second semester. However, sometimes schools have mid-year exams and then final exams. Let me think.

In some Indonesian schools, the academic year starts in July and ends in June. So the final exams would be in June. But I've also heard that some schools might have their final exams in December. But which is more common?

Alternatively, maybe it's during the second semester. If the school year starts in July, then the second semester would end in December. So final exams could be in December. But I'm not entirely sure. I need to check if there's a standard practice.

Wait, some sources indicate that in Indonesia, the school year typically runs from July to June. So the first semester is July to December, and the second is January to June. But that might vary by region or school. If the final exams are at the end of the second semester, that would be June. However, some schools might have their final exams in December as well, depending on their schedule.

But I think the most common answer is that the final exams are in June. Because if the academic year is July to June, the end of the year is June. However, some schools might have mid-year exams in December and final exams in June. So the final term exams would be in June, which is month 6. But I need to be sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the final exams are in December. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider the typical exam schedule for high schools. In many countries, the final exams are after the second semester, which would be around June. For example, in the US, it's June. But in some other countries, like in the Northern Hemisphere, the academic year might be September to June",1,,

{""question"":""On average, how far do students typically pursue their education in Indonesia? (e.g., elementary, high school)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the average education level pursued by students in Indonesia. First, I need to recall what I know about Indonesia's education system. Indonesia has a structured education system that includes elementary, middle, and high school, followed by higher education.

The question is asking about the average level students typically reach. I remember that in many developing countries, not all students complete high school due to various factors like economic constraints, access to education, or personal circumstances. But I need to be specific about Indonesia.

From what I've read before, Indonesia's education system is divided into several stages: primary (elementary) school, which is 6 years, then junior high school (SMP) for 3 years, followed by senior high school (SMA) for another 3 years. After that, there's higher education like universities or vocational schools.

Now, the average completion. I think that many students do complete up to senior high school, but not all proceed to higher education. However, there might be a trend of increasing enrollment in higher education in recent years. But the question is about the average, so maybe it's around high school level.

I should check if there are any statistics or reports. For example, UNESCO or the World Bank might have data on education completion rates. From what I recall, Indonesia's secondary education completion rate is around 80-90%, but that might include both junior and senior high school. However, the average might be that students complete up to senior high school. But I also need to consider that some might drop out before that.

Alternatively, perhaps the average is that most students complete up to high school (senior high school), but not necessarily all. However, the exact figure might be that the average is completing up to senior high school, with some pursuing higher education. But the question is about the average, so maybe the typical is up to high school.

Wait, the example given in the question lists ""elementary, high school"" as examples, so the answer should be in that style. So, the answer would be that on average, students in Indonesia typically pursue their education up to high school (senior high school), with some continuing to higher education. However, the exact average might be that most complete up to high school.

I need to make sure that the answer is accurate. If I'm unsure about the exact percentage, but the question is about the typical level, not the percentage. So the answer would be that students typically complete",1,,

{""question"":""What do people eat on their birthday in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about what people eat on their birthday in Indonesia. Let me think about this. I know that Indonesia has a diverse culture with many islands, so there might be regional variations. But there are probably some common foods that are widely celebrated.

First, I remember that in many Asian countries, cakes are common for birthdays. So maybe Indonesians also have birthday cakes. But I should check if there's a specific type. Then there's the traditional Indonesian desserts. Kuih, which is a type of sweet cake or pastry, might be part of it. Also, maybe something like lemper, which is a rice cake wrapped in banana leaves. 

Wait, but I need to be accurate. Let me think again. In Indonesia, birthdays might involve both Western and traditional foods. For example, people might have a birthday cake similar to Western ones, but also traditional snacks. There's also the possibility of nasi lemak, which is a popular dish, but I'm not sure if it's specifically for birthdays. 

Another thought: in some regions, they might have special dishes. For example, in Java, maybe something like bacang or other local sweets. Also, there's the tradition of having a special meal with family, which could include various dishes like satay, gado-gado, or even fried chicken. 

Wait, but the user wants the answer in a list form. I need to make sure the items are correct. Let me try to recall. Common birthday foods in Indonesia could include:

- Birthday cake (possibly with chocolate or other flavors)
- Kuih (various types of traditional pastries)
- Lemper (a rice cake with chicken or other fillings)
- Nasi lemak (though maybe more general, not specific to birthdays)
- Satay (grilled meat skewers, often served at celebrations)
- Pisang goreng (fried bananas, a popular snack)
- Es campur (a mixed ice dessert)

But I should verify if these are actually associated with birthdays. Maybe the main ones are the cake and traditional desserts. Also, some people might have a special meal with family, which could include multiple dishes. However, the question is about what they eat, not the entire meal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the most common is the birthday cake, and then traditional sweets like kuih or lemper. I think I should list the most commonly recognized items. Let me check if there's a specific traditional dish for birthdays. Maybe not a",1,,

Okay, let's see. The question is asking which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Indonesia attend most frequently.

First, I need to think about the common subjects that students might take extra classes for. In many countries, subjects like math, science, and language are common areas where students seek extra help. But Indonesia might have its own specifics.

I remember that in Indonesia, the national exams are important, especially the Ujian Nasional (UN) for high school students. These exams cover subjects like Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian language), mathematics, science, and social studies. So, students might focus on these subjects for private tutoring.

Also, private institutes often offer classes for exam preparation. For example, there are many private schools and tutoring centers that specialize in preparing students for the UN or other entrance exams. Among these, mathematics is a subject that's often challenging and might require more tutoring. Similarly, English language might be another area where students seek help, as it's a required subject and sometimes considered difficult.

Wait, but maybe the most common is English? Or maybe math? I think in many places, math is a common subject for tutoring. However, in Indonesia, the language of instruction is usually Indonesian, but English is taught as a foreign language. So students might need extra help with English.

Alternatively, maybe the most frequent is for the subjects that are part of the national exams. Since the national exams include math, science, and language, students might attend academies for those. But which one is the most frequent?

I recall that in some reports, math and English are the most common subjects for private tutoring. However, I need to be specific. Maybe in Indonesia, the most frequently attended is English or math. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure of the education system.

In Indonesia, students in middle school (SMP) and high school (SMA) have to take various subjects. Private institutes often offer courses for the most challenging subjects. Since math is a core subject and often a problem area, it's possible that math is the most common. However, in some cases, English might be more in demand because it's a foreign language and required for higher education and exams.

Another angle: there are many private institutions that offer ""bimbel"" (short for bimbingan belajar), which is tutoring. The most popular subjects for bimbel might be math and English. But which is more frequent?

{""question"":""Which subject is considered the most important for students in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Indonesia. Let me start by thinking about the education system there. Indonesia has a national curriculum, so maybe the core subjects are emphasized. Subjects like Mathematics, Science, and Indonesian Language are fundamental. But which one is the most important?

I remember that in many countries, subjects like Mathematics and Science are crucial for STEM fields, but Indonesia might have its priorities. Also, since Indonesian is the national language, it's a key subject. However, there's also the aspect of religious education, as Indonesia is a Muslim-majority country. But the question is about the most important, so maybe it's the one that's most emphasized in exams or required for higher education.

Looking at the national exams, like the Ujian Nasional, which subjects are prioritized? I think Mathematics and Indonesian Language are always included. However, in recent years, there's been a push towards STEM education, so maybe Science or Mathematics. But I'm not sure if one is considered more important than the others.

Wait, the user might be looking for the subject that's most emphasized in the curriculum or required for university entrance. Also, considering the economic context, subjects that lead to better job opportunities might be seen as more important. However, without specific data, it's hard to say. But based on general knowledge, Indonesian Language is fundamental for communication, but other subjects might be seen as more critical for career advancement. However, since the question is about what's considered the most important, perhaps the answer is Indonesian Language, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe Mathematics because it's a foundation for many fields. I need to check if there's any official source or common consensus. Since I can't access current data, I'll go with the most commonly cited subject in Indonesian education, which is Indonesian Language and Literature, as it's a core subject and essential for all students. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe Science. However, I think the answer they're looking for is Indonesian Language. Wait, but in some contexts, Mathematics is considered more important. Hmm. Maybe the answer is Mathematics. But I need to make a decision here. Given that the national exams include Indonesian, Math, and Science, but the most important might be Indonesian as the national language. However, in terms of academic and career preparation, Math and Science are crucial. But without specific data, it's challenging. The safest answer based on general knowledge would be Indonesian Language and Literature",1,,

{""question"":""What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what food items people in Indonesia typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian cuisine and drinking habits.

First, Indonesia has a diverse range of traditional foods, often influenced by various regional cultures. Common dishes include things like nasi goreng (fried rice), satay (grilled skewers), rendang (spicy meat stew), and various types of seafood. However, these are usually paired with local beverages like beer or traditional drinks such as Brem or Arak, which are more of a local spirit.

But the question is about hard liquor, which might refer to stronger alcoholic drinks like whiskey, vodka, or even local spirits. In many cultures, hard liquor is paired with snacks or specific dishes that can complement the strong flavors. For example, in some countries, people might have whiskey with cigars or certain cheeses.

In Indonesia, during social gatherings or parties, people might consume hard liquor. What are the typical snacks served then? Maybe things like chips, crackers, or fried foods. Also, considering the local palate, spicy or savory snacks could be common. However, I should check if there are specific traditional foods that are commonly paired with hard liquor.

But wait, I'm not sure if there's a specific traditional pairing. Maybe it's more about what's available at the time. In bars or nightspots, they might serve standard bar snacks like nuts, pretzels, or maybe even local versions like keripik (crispy snacks made from cassava or potato). Another possibility is street food like pisang goreng (fried bananas) or bakso (meatballs) as appetizers.

However, I need to be careful not to assume. Since the question is about typical pairings, maybe the answer is more general. In many places, people pair hard liquor with salty or savory snacks to balance the alcohol's burn. So in Indonesia, that might translate to items like salted crackers, fried snacks, or even some spicy dishes to complement the liquor.

Alternatively, considering the local context, perhaps when drinking hard liquor, people might have traditional snacks like emping (a type of crispy snack made from melon seeds) or other local chips. Also, maybe some sweet items to contrast with the strong alcohol, like candied fruits or pastries.

But I need to make sure these are actually common pairings. Since I don't have specific data, I should consider that the answer might be more general, listing typical snack items that",1,,

{""question"":""What are the most popular sweets in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most popular sweets in Indonesia. Let me think about this. I know Indonesia has a rich variety of traditional sweets. First, I should recall some common ones.

Pisang goreng comes to mind, which is fried banana. It's a popular street food. Then there's klepon, which are small balls filled with palm sugar and grated coconut, often fried. They're really sweet and chewy.

Another one is onde-onde, similar to klepon but with a different texture, maybe using rice flour. They're also filled with sweet fillings. Then there's es campur, a mixed ice dessert with various ingredients like jelly, fruits, and sweetened condensed milk. That's a popular treat, especially in hot weather.

Lumpia is a spring roll, but sometimes the sweet version is made with ingredients like coconut and sugar. Then there's kuih, which is a general term for various traditional cakes and pastries. Specific types include kuih lapis, which is layered cake, and kuih kapit, a type of sweet pancake.

Bolu is a type of sponge cake, often found in different flavors. Then there's cendol, which is a dessert with green noodles, palm sugar, and coconut milk. It's refreshing and popular in Indonesia.

Wait, are there any others? Maybe jenang, which is a traditional sweet made from glutinous rice flour and palm sugar. Or maybe kacang hijau, which is green bean pudding, but I'm not sure if that's considered a sweet. Also, there's dodol, a sticky, chewy sweet made from coconut and palm sugar, similar to date leather.

I need to make sure these are indeed popular. Let me check if I'm missing any major ones. Es teler is another ice dessert with various fruits and sweet toppings. But maybe that's similar to es campur. Also, there's onde-onde and klepon which are very well-known.

So compiling the list: pisang goreng, klepon, onde-onde, es campur, lumpia, kuih, bolu, cendol, jenang, dodol. That seems comprehensive. I should list these in the JSON format as specified. Make sure each item is correctly spelled and in the right order. Also, check if some items might be regional or not as popular nationwide. But the user just wants the most popular, so these should be safe",1,,

{""question"":""Which job is considered underpaid in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which job is considered underpaid in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indonesian job market. Indonesia has a diverse economy with sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, services, and more. Wages can vary a lot depending on the region and the industry.

First, I remember that in many developing countries, certain sectors like agriculture or informal jobs tend to have lower wages. But I should check if that's the case in Indonesia. Also, there's been talk about the minimum wage in Indonesia. Maybe some jobs don't meet the minimum wage standards, making them underpaid.

Looking at specific professions, maybe domestic workers? I've heard that in some countries, domestic workers are paid less because they're not always covered by labor laws the same way as other workers. In Indonesia, are domestic workers considered underpaid? There was a case where the government tried to increase their minimum wage, which might indicate that they were previously underpaid.

Another possibility is manual labor jobs, like construction workers or factory workers. These jobs might not require formal education, leading to lower pay. But I'm not sure if they are specifically labeled as underpaid in Indonesia. Also, considering the cost of living, even if the wage is above the minimum, it might still be considered underpaid if it doesn't cover basic needs.

There's also the issue of informal sector jobs. Many people in Indonesia work in the informal sector, which might not have regulated wages. Jobs like street vendors, small-scale traders, or casual laborers in the informal economy might be underpaid because they don't have the same protections or benefits as formal employees.

Wait, but the question asks for a single job. Maybe the most commonly cited one is domestic workers. I think in Indonesia, domestic workers are often mentioned in discussions about low wages and poor working conditions. They might not be covered by the same labor laws as other workers, leading to underpayment. Also, there have been campaigns or social movements highlighting the plight of domestic workers in Indonesia, which could indicate that they are considered underpaid.

Alternatively, maybe teachers in certain regions? Or healthcare workers? But I'm not sure if those are the most common examples. Another angle: in some reports, the lowest paid jobs are in the agricultural sector, such as farm laborers. But again, I need to confirm if that's the case.

Given that, I think domestic workers are a strong candidate. They are often in low-wage positions, and there's been advocacy around",1,,

{""question"":""What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Indonesia. Let me think about this. First, I need to recall what I know about Indonesian housing and gardens. Indonesia has a tropical climate, so gardens there might be different from temperate regions. 

In many countries, backyards have things like lawns, maybe some fruit trees, or flowers. But in Indonesia, since the climate is hot and humid, maybe they have more plants that thrive in that environment. Also, considering cultural aspects, maybe there are elements specific to Indonesian traditions.

I remember that in some Asian countries, people grow vegetables and herbs in their gardens. So perhaps in Indonesia, back gardens might have vegetable patches or fruit trees like mango, rambutan, or durian. Also, maybe there are ornamental plants or flowers like hibiscus or frangipani, which are common in tropical regions.

Another thought: in some cultures, there's a tradition of having a small pond or water feature in the garden. I'm not sure if that's common in Indonesia, but maybe. Also, maybe chickens or other small animals, but that might be more in rural areas.

Wait, the question says ""typically found,"" so it's probably more common in certain areas. Maybe in urban areas, backyards are smaller, so they might have more ornamental plants, while in rural areas, there's more agriculture. But the answer should be general.

I should also consider that some houses might have a ""taman"" which is a garden area. Maybe there's a mix of fruit trees, vegetables, and ornamental plants. Also, maybe there are traditional plants like the banyan tree, which is common in Southeast Asia.

But I need to be careful not to assume. Let me check if there are any specific plants or elements commonly associated with Indonesian backyards. From what I know, the use of space might be efficient, so gardens might include both functional (vegetables, fruit) and aesthetic elements.

So putting it all together, the answer might be a list that includes fruit trees, vegetable gardens, ornamental plants, and maybe a water feature. However, the user wants one single answer as a list. But the question says ""typically found,"" so perhaps the most common thing is fruit trees or vegetable gardens. Wait, but maybe the answer is more specific. 

Alternatively, considering that in many Indonesian homes, especially in urban areas, backyards might have a mix of plants, but the",1,,

{""question"":""What are the family-related holidays in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the family-related holidays in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian public holidays. First, there's Lebaran, which is the end of Ramadan. That's a big one because it's a time for family reunions and visiting relatives.

Then there's Christmas, but I think that's more for Christians, though some families might celebrate it. Wait, but not sure if it's considered a family-related holiday in the broader sense. Maybe it's more religious than family-focused.

Idul Fitri is definitely a major family holiday. Then there's Nyepi, which is the Balinese New Year. That's a day of silence and reflection, so families might spend time together.

Other holidays include Independence Day on August 17th, but that's more national. Maybe not family-specific. Then there's the Islamic New Year, Hijriyah, but I'm not sure if that's widely observed as a family holiday.

Wait, I should check if there are others. Maybe the Day of the Indonesian Unity (Sarinah) in December? Not sure. Also, some local holidays might be family-related, but they might not be national. The user probably wants national holidays.

So compiling the main ones: Lebaran (Idul Fitri), Nyepi, and maybe Christmas. But I need to confirm. Some sources might list Lebaran, Nyepi, and maybe the Islamic New Year. However, the Islamic New Year might not be as widely celebrated as Lebaran. Also, there's the Day of the Nation (Hari Kebangkitan Nasional) in May, but that's more about national awakening.

I think the main family-related holidays are Lebaran (Idul Fitri), Nyepi, and Christmas. Wait, but Christmas is only for Christians. However, the question is about family-related, not necessarily religious. Maybe the answer includes both religious and secular ones. So perhaps Lebaran, Nyepi, and maybe others.

Wait, another thought: the Day of the Indonesian Unity (Hari Kesatuan Bangsa) on December 1st? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is just Lebaran and Nyepi. But I should verify. Let me think again: Lebaran is definitely family-oriented. Nyepi is a day of rest, so families might gather. Christmas is a family holiday, but maybe only for a minority. However, the",1,,

{""question"":""Who is the most popular soccer coach in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular soccer coach in Indonesia is. Let me start by recalling any Indonesian football coaches I know. There's maybe someone from the national team? Or perhaps a well-known club coach.

First, I know that Indonesia has a national football team, and they might have had different coaches over the years. I remember that someone like Luis Milla was the coach for the Indonesian national team a while back. But I'm not sure if he's still the most popular. Also, there's a coach named Shin Tae-yong, but I think he's from South Korea. Wait, no, maybe he's been coaching Indonesia's national team more recently. I think he took over after Luis Milla. But is he the most popular?

Then there are club coaches. I'm not too familiar with Indonesian clubs, but maybe someone like Paulus Allen, who has been a coach in the Indonesian league. Or maybe someone else. I should check if any of these coaches have a significant following or have led teams to notable achievements.

Another angle: popularity might be influenced by media presence, social media followers, or success in competitions. If a coach has won major titles or has a large fanbase, they might be more popular. For example, if Shin Tae-yong led the national team to a significant tournament or qualification, that could make him popular. Alternatively, a club coach who has a successful team might be more well-known.

Wait, but I need to be careful with the current status. If the question is about the present time, I need to know the latest information. However, since I can't access real-time data, I have to rely on my existing knowledge up to 2023. As of my knowledge cutoff, Shin Tae-yong was appointed as the head coach of the Indonesia national team in 2021. He's a South Korean coach, but he's been in the spotlight for leading Indonesia. However, popularity might also be influenced by local preferences. Some might prefer a local coach over a foreign one.

Alternatively, there's a coach named Indra Sjafri, who has been involved with the national team as an assistant or in other roles. But I'm not sure if he's the head coach. Also, there's a name like Bima Sakti, who has been a coach for the national team. Wait, Bima Sakti was the head coach of the Indonesia national team before Luis Milla.",1,,

Okay, the user is asking about the most popular winter sport in Indonesia. Let me think.

First, Indonesia is a tropical country with a warm climate all year round. Winter sports typically require cold temperatures, like skiing or ice hockey. But in Indonesia, there's not much snow or ice naturally. However, maybe there are some winter sports that are popular despite the climate.

Wait, maybe they have indoor facilities or imported sports. For example, maybe ice skating? But I'm not sure if that's widespread. Alternatively, maybe something like snowboarding, but that would require artificial snow or specific resorts. Are there any winter sports events or facilities in Indonesia?

I should check if there are any notable winter sports in Indonesia. Maybe some people participate in winter sports as a novelty or through imports. However, considering the climate, it's possible that there isn't a traditional winter sport popular there. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that there's no popular winter sport due to the climate, but the question assumes there is one.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a specific sport that's practiced in Indonesia during the winter months, even if it's not a traditional winter sport. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there isn't a popular winter sport because of the lack of snow, but the question expects an answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a sport like skiing in certain highland areas. For example, in Java or Bali, but I don't think they have natural snow. Maybe there are ski resorts with artificial snow, but I'm not aware of any in Indonesia. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the most popular winter sport is not a traditional one, but something like ice hockey or figure skating, even if it's not widely practiced. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is that there isn't a popular winter sport in Indonesia due to the lack of snow and cold climate. However, the question is phrased as if there is one. Maybe I should check sources or common knowledge. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the most popular winter sport is snowboarding, but that's only in specific places. However, I think the correct answer is that Indonesia doesn't have a popular winter sport due to its climate. But I need to confirm.

{""question"":""What is the most popular water sport in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular water sport in Indonesia is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesia's geography and culture. Indonesia is an archipelago with thousands of islands, so water activities are probably common there.

First, I should think about the types of water sports that are popular in tropical regions. Snorkeling and scuba diving come to mind because of the coral reefs. Indonesia has places like Raja Ampat and Bali, which are known for diving. Then there's surfing, especially in places like Bali and Java, where there are consistent waves. 

But wait, the question is about the most popular. Maybe I should check if there's a sport that's more widely participated in than others. Scuba diving and snorkeling are popular for tourists, but maybe for locals, it's something else. There's also traditional boat racing or something like that? Or maybe fishing as a sport? But fishing might not be considered a sport in the same way.

Another angle: major events or competitions. If there's a national competition or a sport that's widely covered in media, that might indicate popularity. For example, Indonesia has a strong presence in surfing, with athletes competing internationally. However, if the question is about participation rather than competitive sports, maybe it's different.

Also, considering the number of people engaging in the sport. Snorkeling and diving are accessible to many tourists, which could contribute to their popularity. But for locals, maybe it's more about traditional activities. However, I'm not sure about traditional water sports in Indonesia. 

Another thought: paddle sports like kayaking or stand-up paddleboarding might be growing in popularity, but I don't know if they're the most popular. 

Looking up some sources in my mind, I remember that Bali is a major tourist destination for diving and snorkeling. Also, the Komodo Islands are known for diving. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular overall. 

Wait, maybe the answer is scuba diving. But I should verify if there's a more popular one. Alternatively, maybe it's surfing, given the beaches and the presence of surf schools. However, in terms of sheer numbers, perhaps snorkeling is more common because it's easier and doesn't require as much equipment as diving. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is something else like fishing or boat racing. But I think the most commonly cited water sports in Indonesia are diving and snorkeling. Between those two, which is more popular",1,,

{""question"":""Which cities or regions are known for their import and export activities in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which cities or regions in Indonesia are known for import and export activities. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesia's economy and major ports.

First, Indonesia is an archipelago with many islands, so ports are crucial for trade. The largest cities are likely to be major hubs. Jakarta comes to mind as the capital and a major economic center. It probably has significant ports and trade activities.

Then there's Surabaya, which I remember is the second-largest city and has a major port. It's in East Java, so maybe it's a key point for exports, especially textiles or other manufactured goods.

Batam is another place I've heard of. It's a special economic zone near Singapore, known for manufacturing and exports, maybe electronics or automotive parts. It's part of Riau Islands province.

Semarang is in Central Java. I think it has a port that handles a lot of cargo, maybe agricultural products or other goods. It might be important for both imports and exports.

Medan in North Sumatra might be significant too, especially for palm oil exports, which are a big part of Indonesia's economy. The port there could handle a lot of that.

There's also Makassar in South Sulawesi. I believe it's a major port for the eastern part of the country, handling both imports and exports, maybe including minerals or other resources from the region.

Banten, near Jakarta, has the Port of Tanjung Priok, which is one of the busiest in Indonesia. That's probably a key area for trade activities.

I should also consider regions like Papua, but I'm not sure if it's as prominent in trade as the others. Maybe the Maluku Islands, but I think the main ones are the ones I listed earlier.

Let me double-check: Jakarta, Surabaya, Batam, Semarang, Medan, Makassar, Banten. Are there others? Maybe Balikpapan in East Kalimantan, which is a major port for coal exports. But the user asked for cities or regions, so perhaps include Balikpapan as well. However, the initial list might be more accurate. I need to ensure these cities are indeed recognized for their import/export activities.

Alternatively, the main ports are Jakarta (Tanjung Priok), Surabaya, Semarang, Batam, Medan, Makassar. Maybe also Palembang in South Sumatra, but I'm",1,,

{""question"":""How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Indonesia? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indonesian education system. Middle school in Indonesia is typically referred to as SMP (Sekolah Menengah Pertama), which is the first stage of secondary education, usually for students aged 12 to 15.

Now, the curriculum in Indonesia is regulated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. The subjects taught can vary slightly depending on the school, whether it's a public or private institution, and whether it follows the standard curriculum or a specialized one. However, the core curriculum is standardized across the country.

From what I remember, the core subjects in Indonesian middle schools include subjects like Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia), Mathematics, Science (IPA), Social Studies (IPS), English, Islamic Education (for Muslim students), and Physical Education. There might also be subjects like Art, Music, and Civic Education. However, I need to check if these are all considered separate subjects or if some are combined.

Wait, in some cases, Islamic Education and Civic Education might be separate, but I'm not sure. Also, there's the subject of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) which might be included in some schools. Additionally, there could be vocational subjects in certain schools, but I think the question is about the standard middle school curriculum.

I should look up the standard number of subjects. However, since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on existing knowledge. Let me think again. The standard curriculum for SMP in Indonesia includes seven core subjects: Indonesian, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, English, Islamic Education, and Physical Education. However, some sources mention that there might be more subjects when considering the different subjects in the curriculum, such as Art, Music, and Civic Education, which are sometimes considered separate.

Wait, but perhaps the count varies. For example, in some cases, Science and Social Studies might be split into more specific subjects. However, according to the 2013 curriculum, which is the current one, the core subjects are as follows: Indonesian, Mathematics, Science (IPA), Social Studies (IPS), English, Islamic Education, and Physical Education. That's seven subjects. However, some schools might add additional subjects like Art, Music, and Civic Education, bringing the total to around 10 or more.

{""question"":""Which writers are commonly studied in literature class in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which writers are commonly studied in Indonesian literature classes. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indonesian literature. Indonesia has a rich literary tradition, both pre-colonial and post-colonial. 

First, there are the classical Indonesian poets and writers. Maybe people like Mpu Prapanca or Amir Hamzah? Wait, Amir Hamzah was a poet from the 14th century, right? Then there's the modern era. I remember that Sapardi Djoko Damono is a contemporary poet who's often taught. Also, Pramoedya Ananta Toer comes to mind. He's a very famous novelist, especially for his Buru Quartet. 

Then there are women writers. Siti Nurbaya is a classic novel by Marah Rusli, so she's probably studied. Maybe also Chairil Anwar, though he's a poet. And what about the modern ones like Seno Gumira Ajidarma? He's a contemporary writer. 

Wait, I should check if these are actually part of the standard curriculum. In Indonesian schools, the literature classes might focus on both traditional and modern works. So, classical writers like those from the classical period, then the modern writers who are part of the Indonesian literary canon. 

Also, maybe some authors from the 20th century. For example, Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana is a key figure in modern Indonesian literature. Then there's the poet W.S. Rendra. 

I should make sure to include both poets and novelists. Let me list them out: 

- Pramoedya Ananta Toer
- Sapardi Djoko Damono
- Chairil Anwar
- Siti Nurbaya (author of the novel Siti Nurbaya)
- Marah Rusli
- Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana
- W.S. Rendra
- Mpu Prapanca (though he's older, maybe not in modern classes)
- Maybe also Raden Adjeng Kartini, as she's a significant figure in Indonesian literature and history.

Wait, but the question is about literature classes. So maybe Kartini is more of a historical figure, but her letters are studied. 

I think the most commonly studied would be Pramoedya, Sapardi, Chairil Anwar, Marah Rusli, Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, and W.S. Rendra. Also, maybe someone",1,,

{""question"":""What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Indonesia?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Indonesia. Let me start by recalling Indonesian cuisine. There are a lot of different dishes, but some common ones include nasi goreng, satay, gado-gado, rendang, and maybe some traditional snacks.

Now, thinking about what might be disliked by kids. Children often prefer sweet or mild flavors, while adults, especially the elderly, might have a taste for more complex or spicy foods. But wait, some traditional Indonesian foods are quite spicy. However, maybe there's a specific dish that's considered too strong for children but is a favorite among older people.

Another angle is the texture. Some foods might be tough or have strong flavors that kids don't like. For example, certain types of fermented foods or dishes with strong spices. Let me think about specific examples. There's a dish called ""lontong"" which is rice cake with peanut sauce, but I'm not sure if that's disliked by kids. Or maybe ""soto"" which is a soup, but again, not sure.

Wait, there's a dish called ""kerak telor"" which is a type of omelette with eggs and rice. But I'm not certain if that's the one. Alternatively, maybe ""tempe"" which is a soy product. But I think tempe is more commonly eaten by all ages. 

Wait, I remember that in some cultures, certain foods are considered more suitable for adults. For instance, in Indonesia, ""kopi"" (coffee) is often consumed by adults, but maybe that's not a food. Another thought: ""sambal"" (chili paste) is very spicy. Maybe dishes that are heavily spiced with sambal. But again, not sure if that's specifically disliked by children.

Alternatively, maybe ""tahu"" (tofu) is a common food, but I don't think that's disliked by kids. Wait, perhaps ""lalap"" which is raw vegetables with sambal. Kids might not like the raw vegetables or the spicy sambal. But would the elderly enjoy that? Maybe they do, but is it a common example?

Alternatively, thinking about fermented foods. ""Kecap"" (soy sauce) is used in many dishes. But again, not sure. Another possibility is ""pepes"" which is a grilled fish or meat wrapped in banana leaves and cooked with spices. The strong spices might be",1,,
