{""question"":""What soccer teams in Azerbaijan are famous for their intense rivalry? (e.g. ___ vs ___)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which soccer teams in Azerbaijan have an intense rivalry. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani football. The country has a few well-known clubs, especially in the top league.

First, there's FC Qasimiyah, which is based in Baku. They've been around for a while and have a strong fan base. Then there's Neftchi Baku, another prominent team from Baku. Neftchi has a history of success and competition. Another team is Khazar Lankaran, which is from Lankaran. They might have rivalries with Baku-based teams because of the geographical divide. 

Wait, there's also FK Sabah, which is a newer team but has been making waves. They might have a rivalry with older clubs like Qasimiyah or Neftchi. Also, considering the historical context, maybe there's a rivalry between Neftchi and Qasimiyah since they're both from Baku and have competitive matches. 

I should check if there's a specific derby known as the ""Baku derby"" between Neftchi and Qasimiyah. Also, Khazar Lankaran vs. Neftchi might be another rivalry because of their different regions. But I need to confirm which rivalries are most famous. 

Another possibility is between FK Baku and other teams, but I think FK Baku might not be as prominent as the others. Let me make sure. The most intense rivalry is likely between Neftchi Baku and Qasimiyah Baku, as they are both major clubs in the capital. Additionally, Khazar Lankaran vs. Neftchi might be another significant rivalry due to their contrasting locations and histories. 

So, putting it together, the main rivalries would be Neftchi Baku vs Qasimiyah Baku and possibly Neftchi Baku vs Khazar Lankaran. But I need to ensure these are the ones most recognized. Let me verify quickly. Yes, the Baku derby between Neftchi and Qasimiyah is well-known. Khazar Lankaran's rivalry with Neftchi is also notable. However, the user might be expecting the most famous one. Maybe just the Baku derby is the primary answer. But the question says ""famous for their intense rivalry"" so maybe list the main ones. Alternatively, perhaps there's another rivalry.

{""question"":""Which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani students and their educational choices.

First, I know that Azerbaijan has a strong emphasis on higher education, and many students pursue degrees abroad, especially in countries like Russia, Turkey, and the United States. But which fields are they studying? I remember hearing that engineering is a popular choice. Maybe because there are good engineering programs in countries like Russia and Georgia, which are nearby. Also, oil and gas industries are significant in Azerbaijan, so maybe engineering related to that field? But I'm not sure if it's specifically petroleum engineering or general engineering.

Another possibility is medicine. I think some students go to study medicine in countries like Ukraine or Russia, which have well-regarded medical schools. However, I'm not certain if that's the most common compared to other fields.

Then there's business and economics. With Azerbaijan's growing economy and its position as a transit country for energy, business and economics might be in demand. Students might go to study in the UK or the US for MBA programs or business administration.

Computer science and IT could be another field. With the rise of technology, maybe more students are going abroad for tech-related degrees. But I'm not sure if that's the case in Azerbaijan specifically.

I should also consider the availability of scholarships or easier admission processes. For example, some countries offer scholarships that make studying abroad more accessible. If Russia has scholarships for engineering, that might contribute to more students choosing that field.

Wait, I remember reading a report or article that mentioned engineering as the top field for Azerbaijani students studying abroad. It might be because of the strong ties with Russian universities and the demand for engineers in Azerbaijan's industrial sectors. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the energy sector, where engineering skills are crucial.

But I need to be careful. I shouldn't assume without evidence. Let me think if there are any other factors. The Azerbaijani government might have partnerships with certain universities abroad, or there could be a trend based on employment opportunities. If there's a shortage of skilled engineers in Azerbaijan, students might go abroad to get the necessary education.

Another angle: looking at the number of students. If a large percentage of Azerbaijani students studying abroad are in engineering, that would be the answer. I think that's the case. I've heard that engineering is one of the most popular fields for Azerbaijani students, especially in countries like",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most preferred recreational facility among children in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the most preferred recreational facility among children in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's culture and available facilities. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and like many countries, children have various places to play and have fun.

First, I should think about common recreational facilities. Parks are usually popular because they offer open spaces for playing, sports, and outdoor activities. Then there are playgrounds, which are specifically designed for children with swings, slides, and other equipment. Amusement parks might be another option, but they might be less common or more expensive, so maybe not the most preferred. Sports centers or community centers could also be a possibility, especially if they have facilities like swimming pools, gyms, or sports fields.

I should consider the availability. Azerbaijan has cities like Baku, which is the capital, and other urban areas. In cities, parks and playgrounds are more accessible. The Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku is a cultural venue, but that's more for adults and cultural events. Maybe public parks like the Garden of the People in Baku are popular spots for children. Also, there might be indoor play areas or arcades, but those might be less common compared to outdoor spaces.

Another angle is cultural factors. In many countries, parks are a primary place for children to play, especially in areas where outdoor activities are encouraged. If there's a strong emphasis on community spaces, parks might be the answer. However, I should check if there's any specific data or surveys about children's preferences in Azerbaijan. Since I don't have access to current surveys, I'll have to rely on general knowledge.

Considering that playgrounds are specifically designed for children's play, they might be the most preferred. However, in some contexts, parks are broader and include playgrounds. Maybe the answer is playgrounds. Alternatively, if there's a specific park known for children's activities, that could be it. But without specific data, the safest bet might be playgrounds or public parks.

Wait, the question is about the most preferred. If I think about typical answers to similar questions in other countries, parks are often cited. However, playgrounds are more specific. But maybe in Azerbaijan, due to climate or urban planning, parks are more prevalent. Alternatively, maybe sports facilities like football fields or skate parks are popular. However, without specific information, it's hard to say.

Since I can't find exact data, I'll go",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""What do people from Azerbaijan eat in Eid ul Fitr?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what people in Azerbaijan eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me start by recalling what Eid ul Fitr is. It's the Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. So, during this time, people usually have special foods and meals.

Now, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their cuisine is influenced by both Middle Eastern and Central Asian traditions. I know that in many Muslim countries, traditional dishes during Eid include things like sweets, pastries, and special meats. For example, in some places, they might have dishes like baklava or other desserts.

Wait, but I need to be specific to Azerbaijan. Let me think. I remember that Azerbaijani cuisine has dishes like plov (a type of rice dish with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed grape leaves or vegetables), and various types of kebabs. But during Eid, maybe they have specific dishes. Also, since it's a time of celebration, there might be more sweets and festive foods.

I think there's a dish called ""shekerbura"" which is a sweet pastry, similar to a turnover filled with nuts and sugar. That might be eaten during Eid. Also, ""gatat"" is a type of sweet bread, maybe similar to a brioche, which could be part of the celebrations. Another possibility is ""muhajjan,"" which is a type of stuffed flatbread, but I'm not sure if that's specifically for Eid.

There's also ""qurut"" which is a dried dairy product, but I'm not sure if that's eaten during Eid. Maybe they have meat dishes like ""kufte"" (meatballs) or ""dolma"" as part of the meal. Also, tea is a big part of Azerbaijani culture, so maybe they serve strong black tea with sugar during the celebrations.

Wait, I should check if there are any specific Eid dishes unique to Azerbaijan. Maybe ""sahlab"" which is a drink made from orchid roots, but that's more of a general dessert. Alternatively, ""baklava"" is popular in many countries, so it's possible they eat that too. Also, ""halva"" might be another sweet.

Putting this together, the main dishes might include traditional sweets like shekerbura, gatat, and baklava, along with main courses like plov, dolma, and kebabs. They might",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and sports.

First, Azerbaijan is a country with a rich tradition in various sports. They have a strong presence in sports like wrestling, which is part of their cultural heritage. But I'm not sure if that's typically a family sport. Then there's football (soccer), which is very popular in Azerbaijan. Maybe families play football together? Also, considering the climate, maybe outdoor sports are more common. 

I should think about sports that are accessible and not too physically demanding for both adults and children. Maybe something like badminton or table tennis? But are those common in Azerbaijan? Alternatively, traditional games might be played. I remember that in many countries, games like tag or hide and seek are common, but those aren't exactly sports.

Another angle: looking at the country's Olympic participation. Azerbaijan has athletes in boxing, weightlifting, and gymnastics. But again, those are individual or competitive sports, not necessarily family activities. 

Wait, maybe they play volleyball or basketball in local parks? Or maybe even something like chess, but that's more of a mental game. 

Alternatively, considering the popularity of martial arts in Azerbaijan, maybe something like judo or karate, but again, those are more structured and might not be played casually by families. 

Wait, I think I've heard that in some countries, family sports like playing catch with a ball, or maybe even traditional games like ""kabaddi"" but I'm not sure if that's in Azerbaijan. 

Alternatively, maybe they play sports like swimming, but that would require access to pools. 

Wait, another thought: Azerbaijan has a tradition of horseback riding, but that's more of a cultural activity and might not be common for families to do together. 

I think the most plausible answers are football (soccer) and wrestling. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they play games like ""bully"" or ""tag"" which are common worldwide. However, the question specifies sports, so maybe more structured activities. 

Looking up some references (even though I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge). In many countries, parents and children play football together. Also, maybe volleyball or basketball. But I'm not sure about Azerbaijan specifically. 

Alternatively, considering the popularity of wrestling in Azerbaijan, maybe that's a family sport. But I'm",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, the user is asking about the most popular stew in Azerbaijan. Let me think. I know that in many countries, there's a traditional dish that's really famous. For Azerbaijan, I remember hearing about a stew called ""pilaf,"" but wait, isn't pilaf more of a rice dish? Maybe I'm mixing it up. Another possibility is ""dolma,"" which are stuffed vegetables, but that's more of an appetizer or side dish. Then there's ""kəbəb,"" which is grilled meat, but again, not a stew.

Wait, maybe it's ""tovuq pilafı,"" which is chicken pilaf. But I'm not sure if that's considered a stew. Alternatively, there's ""shish kebab,"" but again, that's grilled. Let me check my memory. Oh, right! The most popular stew in Azerbaijan is actually ""pilaf,"" but I need to confirm if that's accurate. Or perhaps ""kərə"" which is a type of soup? No, that's not stew. Another thought: ""qazma"" is a type of meat stew, but is that the most popular?

Wait, I think I might be confusing different dishes. Let me try to recall. Azerbaijan has a dish called ""pilaf"" which is a rice dish with meat and vegetables, but sometimes it's prepared in a way that's similar to a stew. Alternatively, ""dolma"" is more common. Hmm, maybe I should look up the most common stews. Alternatively, ""shish kebab"" isn't a stew. Wait, maybe ""tovuq pilafı"" is considered a stew in some contexts. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, I've heard that ""pilaf"" is one of the national dishes of Azerbaijan, so perhaps that's the answer. But I need to be sure. Let me think again. The user is asking specifically for a stew, so maybe ""pilaf"" isn't the right answer. Another possibility is ""kərə"" but that's a soup. Maybe ""qurut"" is a type of stew? No, that's dried meat.

{""question"":""Who is the most well known and successful entrepreneur in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most well-known and successful entrepreneur in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall prominent business figures from Azerbaijan. The country has a few notable entrepreneurs, especially in the energy sector since oil and gas are major industries there. One name that comes to mind is Heydar Aliyev, but wait, he was the president, not an entrepreneur. Maybe his family? His son, Ilham Aliyev, is the current president, so probably not the right answer here.

Another possibility is people involved in the oil industry. There's a company called SOCAR, which is the state-owned oil company. Maybe someone from there? But I'm not sure if they're considered entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are usually private individuals starting businesses, not necessarily government officials.

Wait, there's a name that's often mentioned in Azerbaijani business circles: Rovnag Abdullayev. He's the founder of Caspian Energy, which is involved in oil and gas. He's also had a significant role in the energy sector, including being the chairman of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). But is he the most well-known?

Another name is Farid Mammadov, who is the founder of the Azneft and Neftchilar Bank. However, I'm not certain about his current prominence compared to others.

Alternatively, there's Araz Azimov, who is the founder of Tofiq Bank and has been involved in various business ventures. He's also a member of the Parliament, which might add to his visibility.

Wait, but maybe the answer they're looking for is Heydar Aliyev's son, but he's the president. That might not be the entrepreneur they want. I need to check if there's a more prominent private entrepreneur.

I think Rovnag Abdullayev is a strong candidate because of his role in SOCAR and Caspian Energy. However, I should verify if there's someone else more recognized. Another possibility is Rashad Eyyubov, who is the founder of Azneft and has been involved in energy and banking.

Alternatively, looking at the list of billionaires from Azerbaijan, there's Rashad Eyyubov and Rovnag Abdullayev. Both are prominent. But which one is more well-known?

{""question"":""What is the most popular weekday evening family activity in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the most popular weekday evening family activity in Azerbaijan. First, I need to think about what activities are common there. Azerbaijan is a country with a mix of traditions and modern influences. 

I know that in many countries, family activities in the evening might include things like dining out, watching TV, or going to parks. But I should consider specific cultural aspects. For example, in some Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, family gatherings at home are common, maybe with tea or meals. 

Azerbaijan has a rich cultural heritage, and they have traditional music and dance. However, weekday evenings might be more about relaxation rather than events. Maybe watching TV shows or movies? Or perhaps going to a café or restaurant together. 

Another angle: public parks or recreational areas. In many places, families enjoy spending time outdoors in the evenings. Maybe walking in parks or having picnics. But I'm not sure if that's the most popular.

Also, considering the work schedule, weekday evenings after work might lead families to unwind at home. Maybe having dinner together, which is a common family activity. But is that the most popular?

Wait, I've heard that in some regions, visiting relatives or friends in the evening is common. But that might be more on weekends. 

Alternatively, maybe attending cultural events or festivals, but those might be less common on weekdays. 

I think the most plausible answer is that families gather at home for dinner and relaxation, possibly watching TV or listening to music. However, I need to verify if there's a specific activity more prevalent. 

Another thought: Azerbaijan has a tradition of tea culture. Maybe having tea together in the evening is a significant activity. But is that considered a family activity specifically?

Alternatively, going to a local café or restaurant for a family meal. But again, that's similar to dinner at home.

I should check if there's any data or common knowledge about this. Since I can't access current data, I'll rely on general knowledge. In many cultures, family dinners are a key evening activity. Given that, and considering the importance of family in Azerbaijani culture, the most popular weekday evening family activity is likely having dinner together at home. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe watching TV shows or movies as a family.

Wait, but the question specifies ""weekday evening,"" so maybe it's more about after-work activities. If the family has dinner together, that's a common activity. I",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""How long is the typical probation period for new employees before signing a formal contract in Azerbaijan? (e.g., 1 month)."",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the typical probation period for new employees in Azerbaijan before signing a formal contract. Let me start by recalling what I know about labor laws in Azerbaijan.

First, I remember that many countries have specific regulations regarding probation periods. In some places, it's common to have a probationary period before the official contract is signed. But I'm not exactly sure about Azerbaijan's specifics.

I think Azerbaijan's labor laws might be influenced by its status as a former Soviet republic, so maybe there are some similarities with other post-Soviet states. However, each country has its own regulations. Let me try to recall or find information on this.

I recall that in some countries, like Russia, the probation period can be up to three months, but I'm not sure if that applies to Azerbaijan. I should check if there's a legal framework in Azerbaijan that sets the maximum probation period.

Looking up, the Labor Code of Azerbaijan might have provisions on this. From what I can remember, the Labor Code of Azerbaijan sets the maximum probation period for employees. Let me think. I think it's up to three months, but maybe it's shorter. Alternatively, maybe it's two months. Wait, I need to be precise here.

Another angle: sometimes the probation period is agreed upon between the employer and employee, but there might be a legal cap. If the law allows up to three months, then the typical period could be around one to three months, but the question is asking for the typical duration, not the maximum.

Wait, I think the standard probation period in Azerbaijan is one month. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me try to verify. If I can't find exact information, maybe I should state that it's up to three months as per the Labor Code, but the typical is one month. However, the question is about the typical period before signing a formal contract. Maybe in practice, employers often use a one-month probation period, even though the law allows longer.

Alternatively, maybe the probation period is included in the initial contract, not before signing. Wait, the question says ""before signing a formal contract,"" which might be a bit confusing. Typically, the probation period is part of the employment contract. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, but assuming that the user is asking about the probation period that is part of the initial contract, which is signed upon hiring.

In that case, the standard probation period in Azerbaijan, according to the Labor Code, is up",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What eating utensils do people commonly used in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what eating utensils are commonly used in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and dining habits.

First, I know that in many countries in the Caucasus region, including Azerbaijan, people often use a combination of utensils. From what I remember, the traditional meal in Azerbaijan is called ""pilaf,"" which is a rice dish, and they often eat with their hands, especially when it comes to certain dishes like ""dolma"" or ""kəbab."" However, I also think that forks and spoons are commonly used, similar to other countries in the region.

Wait, but I should be careful here. In some parts of the Caucasus, like Georgia or Armenia, people use a knife and fork, but maybe in Azerbaijan, there's a different custom. I think the use of hands might be more common for certain dishes, but for others, utensils are preferred. Also, there's the ""khanum"" or ""sazan"" which is a type of flatbread, and I'm not sure if that's eaten with hands or utensils.

Another angle: looking at the influence of neighboring countries. Azerbaijan is close to Iran, and in Iran, people use a knife and fork for main dishes, but also eat with hands for some foods. However, in Azerbaijan, I think the use of a fork and spoon is more prevalent, especially in urban areas. Maybe the traditional way involves using hands for certain foods, but in modern settings, utensils are standard.

Wait, I should check if there's a specific utensil unique to Azerbaijan. I don't recall any specific utensil that's unique to the country. They probably use the same as other countries in the region. So, the main utensils would be fork, knife, spoon. But also, considering that in some cases hands are used, especially with dishes like plov (pilaf) or when eating with fingers, like with certain types of bread or dishes that are meant to be eaten by hand.

But the question is about commonly used utensils. So maybe the answer includes both utensils and the use of hands. However, the user might be looking for the utensils, not the hand usage. Let me think again. In most formal or restaurant settings, fork, knife, and spoon would be used. For example, when eating meat dishes, a knife and fork are necessary. For soups or stews, a spoon.",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What type of alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking what type of alcoholic drink is most commonly consumed at festivals in Azerbaijan. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

First, I know that Azerbaijan has a rich culture with various traditions. They have a history of producing different types of alcohol. Let me think about the common drinks there. There's vodka, but I'm not sure if that's the main one. Then there's something called ""shampan"" which is a local sparkling wine, maybe similar to champagne. But is that consumed at festivals?

Wait, I remember that Azerbaijani cuisine includes a lot of dishes that are paired with specific drinks. Also, considering the region, maybe they have traditional spirits. Oh, there's a drink called ""sbiten,"" which is a spiced wine, but I think that's more of a traditional drink rather than festival-specific. 

Wait, another thought: in many countries, beer is a common festival drink. But Azerbaijan has a strong tradition of wine production. The country has a long history of winemaking, dating back thousands of years. So maybe wine is more common. However, the question specifies festivals. 

I should also consider any local holidays or events. For example, Novruz is a major festival in Azerbaijan. What do people drink during Novruz? I think they might have traditional beverages. But is it a specific type of alcohol?

Alternatively, maybe they have a local spirit. Let me check my memory. There's ""arak,"" which is a type of spirit, but I'm not sure about its prevalence. Or maybe ""chacha,"" which is a type of plum brandy. However, chacha is more associated with Georgia. 

Wait, Azerbaijan is known for its local wines, especially in regions like Kakheti, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, Kakheti is in Georgia. Azerbaijan's wine regions are places like Nagorno-Karabakh, but that's a disputed area. Maybe the main wine-producing regions are elsewhere. 

Alternatively, maybe the most common alcoholic drink at festivals is ""shampan,"" which is a local sparkling wine. But I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: in many festivals, people might prefer something stronger, like vodka or brandy. However, considering the cultural context, perhaps wine is more common. 

Wait, I think I've read before that during festivals in Azerbaijan, people often consume ""shampan"" or ""kagor,"" which is a",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan. Let me think. I know that Azerbaijan has a rich culinary tradition influenced by Persian, Turkish, and Central Asian cuisines. Common desserts there might include things like baklava, which is popular in many Middle Eastern and Turkic countries. But wait, is baklava the most popular in Azerbaijan specifically?

Alternatively, there's a dessert called ""shekerbura,"" which is a type of sweet roll or pastry filled with nuts and sugar. I think that's a traditional Azerbaijani dessert. Another possibility is ""gülüstan,"" which is a sweet made from layers of phyllo dough filled with a mix of nuts and raisins, similar to baklava but maybe with a different preparation method.

Wait, I should verify which one is more commonly recognized. From what I recall, shekerbura is often mentioned as a traditional dessert in Azerbaijan. It's a rolled pastry that's similar to a burek but sweet. However, baklava is also very popular there, especially in cities like Baku. But maybe shekerbura is more traditional and specific to Azerbaijani culture compared to baklava, which is more widespread.

I need to be careful here. Another source I remember mentions that ""shekerbura"" is a staple in Azerbaijani desserts. However, sometimes people might confuse it with other similar pastries. Let me cross-check. Yes, shekerbura is indeed a well-known traditional dessert in Azerbaijan. It's made with layers of dough, filled with nuts and sugar, and sometimes dried fruits. It's often served during holidays and special occasions.

So, considering all that, the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan is likely shekerbura. But I should make sure there isn't another dessert that's even more popular. Another thought: ""pilav"" is a rice dish, but that's a main course, not a dessert. ""Muderris"" is a sweet made with wheat germ and nuts, but I'm not sure if it's as popular as shekerbura.

After considering various options and cross-referencing, I think the answer is shekerbura. However, I should confirm once more. A quick mental check: Azerbaijani cuisine's most famous desserts include shekerbura, baklava, and gülüstan. But shekerbura is often cited as the traditional one specific to Azerbaijan.

{""question"":""What is the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan. Let me think.

First, I know that Azerbaijan is a country with a predominantly Muslim population, so Christmas isn't a traditional holiday there. However, there might still be some Christmas songs that are popular, maybe through cultural exchange or in expat communities.

I should check if there are any well-known Christmas songs in the Azerbaijani language. Maybe some local artists have covered classic Christmas songs. Alternatively, maybe ""Silent Night"" or ""Jingle Bells"" are commonly sung, but translated into Azerbaijani.

Wait, I'm not sure if there's an official or widely recognized Christmas song specific to Azerbaijan. It's possible that the most popular one is a translation of a classic, like ""Merry Christmas"" in Azerbaijani. Alternatively, maybe a song by a local artist that's gained popularity during the holiday season.

I need to make sure there isn't a specific song that's been promoted or has a large following. Maybe looking up recent data or surveys about music preferences in Azerbaijan during Christmas. But since I don't have real-time data, I should consider that the answer might be that there isn't a widely recognized Christmas song, but if there is one, it's likely a translated version of a traditional song.

Alternatively, maybe ""Azerbaijan Xristi"" or something similar, but I'm not certain. Without specific information, it's safer to state that Christmas isn't widely celebrated, so there isn't a single most popular song. However, the user might expect an answer even if it's a common translation. Maybe ""Merry Christmas"" in Azerbaijani is the most common, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the safest answer is that there isn't a specific Christmas song that's popular in Azerbaijan due to the cultural context, but if I have to provide one, it might be a local adaptation of a classic. However, I need to check if there's any known song. Maybe ""Yeni Yil"" which is New Year's song, but not Christmas. 

Alternatively, considering that the user might expect an answer, perhaps the most popular is ""Merry Christmas"" in Azerbaijani. But I'm not certain. Since I can't verify, I'll have to go with the information that Christmas isn't widely celebrated there, so there's no official popular Christmas song. However, the user might want an answer, so maybe the best approach is to list ""Merry",1,,,,

{""question"":""What sports event do people from Azerbaijan passionately support the most in international competitions?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which sports event Azerbaijanis support the most in international competitions. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's sports culture.

First, Azerbaijan is a country that has a strong presence in certain sports. I remember that they have a lot of athletes in wrestling, especially freestyle wrestling. They've won several medals in the Olympics and World Championships. Also, they have a good track record in weightlifting. Maybe those are the sports they support?

Wait, but the question is about the sports event, not the sport itself. So maybe it's a specific competition like the Olympics or the World Championships? Or perhaps a specific event within a sport?

Another angle: Azerbaijan has hosted some international events. For example, they hosted the European Games in 2015 and 2023. The European Games are a multi-sport event, similar to the Olympics but on a continental level. Maybe people support that because it's held in their country?

But the question is about international competitions, so the European Games are international. However, the Olympics are more globally recognized. But do Azerbaijanis support the Olympics more than other events?

Also, considering their athletes' success, when their athletes compete in the Olympics, the public might be more engaged. For instance, if they have medalists in wrestling or weightlifting, the people might follow those events closely.

Alternatively, maybe it's the Asian Games, but Azerbaijan is part of the Eurasian region, not Asia. They are part of the European continent, so Asian Games might not be their focus.

Another thought: Azerbaijan has a strong presence in sports like judo, boxing, and maybe even chess. However, the question is about the event, not the sport. So if they have a team that's particularly successful in a certain event, like the World Judo Championships, that could be it.

But I think the most prominent answer here is the Olympics. Because the Olympics are the biggest international competition, and when Azerbaijani athletes compete there, especially in sports they excel in, the public support is high. For example, their wrestlers have won multiple medals in the Olympics, so that event would be a big deal.

Alternatively, maybe the European Championships in their strong sports. But again, the Olympics are more prestigious.

I need to confirm if there's a specific event. However, considering that the question asks for the sports event they support the most, and given that the Olympics are the most prominent international competition, and Azerbaijan has had",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular fruit in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and agriculture.

Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, known for its diverse geography, including mountains and fertile plains. The climate there is probably temperate, which is good for growing various fruits. I remember that grapes are significant in the region, especially for wine production. But wait, the question is about the most popular fruit, not necessarily the one used for wine.

Another thought: fruits like apples, cherries, and pomegranates are common in the Caucasus. Also, I've heard that Azerbaijan has a tradition of growing certain fruits. Maybe apples? Or perhaps something else?

Wait, I should check if there are any specific fruits that are particularly famous in Azerbaijan. For example, in some countries, certain fruits are staples. Maybe apricots? Or maybe melons?

Alternatively, maybe the answer is grapes because of the wine industry, but I'm not sure if that's the most popular in terms of consumption. However, I should be careful not to confuse wine production with general popularity.

Another angle: looking at agricultural exports. Azerbaijan might export certain fruits more than others. But I don't have specific data on that. Alternatively, looking at common fruits in their cuisine. For example, in Azerbaijani dishes, do they use a particular fruit a lot?

Wait, maybe I should think about the most commonly consumed fruits. In many countries, apples are a staple. But I need to be sure about Azerbaijan specifically. Let me try to recall if there are any notable fruits from Azerbaijan. Oh, there's a fruit called ""Azerbaijani melon"" which is known for being sweet and juicy. But is that the most popular?

Alternatively, maybe the answer is grapes. I think in some regions of Azerbaijan, grape farming is extensive, and they produce both table grapes and wine grapes. However, I'm not certain if that's the most popular among the population.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the answer from cultural or traditional aspects. For example, in some countries, certain fruits have symbolic meanings or are used in traditional dishes. However, I'm not sure about Azerbaijan's specific case.

Alternatively, maybe the most popular fruit is the apple. But I need to verify. Since I don't have access to current data, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. Given that grapes are a significant crop and widely consumed, maybe that",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, let's see. The user is asking about a popular activity in parks in Azerbaijan. I need to figure out what that might be.

First, I know that Azerbaijan has several parks, like the one in Baku. People often visit parks for relaxation, maybe walking or jogging. But is there something more specific?

I remember that in many countries, parks are popular for picnics, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe cultural activities? Wait, there's the Heydar Aliyev Center, but that's more of a building. 

Wait, I think in Baku, people go to parks for leisure activities like walking, maybe with family. Also, there's a park called the Garden of the Roses, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe sports? Like playing sports in the park. 

But I need to confirm. Let me think. In many places, parks are used for outdoor activities. Maybe birdwatching? Or maybe there are festivals in parks. However, the user wants one popular activity. 

I think the most common answer would be walking or jogging, but maybe there's a more specific answer. Alternatively, visiting historical sites in parks? Wait, the parks in Azerbaijan might have cultural or historical elements. 

Wait, I found in some sources that parks in Baku are popular for leisure activities like walking, having picnics, and enjoying the green spaces. But the user wants one answer. Maybe the most common is walking or jogging. Alternatively, maybe visiting the parks for their gardens and scenic views. 

But I need to ensure accuracy. Let me check. If I can't find specific info, the safest answer is that people engage in leisure activities like walking, jogging, or picnicking. However, maybe the answer is more specific. 

Wait, I think the answer is that people go for walks, especially in the parks of Baku. So the answer would be ""walking"" or ""jogging"". Alternatively, maybe ""visiting historical monuments in parks"", but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the parks host events like concerts or festivals. But that's not an activity people do in the park on a regular basis.

{""question"":""What region in Azerbaijan has been traditionally associated with agriculture?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking which region in Azerbaijan has been traditionally associated with agriculture. Let me think.

First, I know that Azerbaijan has various regions with different economic activities. The country has a mix of mountainous areas and plains. Agriculture is a significant part of their economy, especially in certain regions.

I remember that the Kura River basin is important for agriculture. The Kura River flows through Azerbaijan, and the surrounding areas are fertile. There's a region called the ""Kura Lowland"" or ""Kura River Valley"" which is known for its agricultural productivity. But I should check if there's a specific region name.

Alternatively, maybe the Ganja region? Ganja is a major city in Azerbaijan, and the surrounding areas might be agricultural. Wait, there's also the region of Nakhchivan, but I think that's more arid. The Shirvan region? Shirvan is known for its historical significance and maybe agriculture.

Wait, another thought: the region of Absheron Peninsula is more industrial and oil-related, so probably not. The Lankaran region is in the south, near the Caspian Sea, and has a subtropical climate, which is good for agriculture. Lankaran is known for its tea plantations and fruits. That might be the answer.

But I should confirm. Let me think again. The Kura River valley is considered the main agricultural area. The region around the Kura River, which includes parts of the country's central and eastern areas, has been historically important for farming. However, the exact name of the region might be the ""Kura River Basin"" or ""Kura Lowlands."" But in Azerbaijani, it's called ""Kura Dölyü"" or ""Kura Ovezli."" However, the user might be expecting a specific region name.

Alternatively, maybe the ""Shirvan"" region. Shirvan is known for its agricultural activities, including vineyards and orchards. But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is the ""Ganja"" region, as Ganja is a significant agricultural center.

Wait, checking my memory: Lankaran is definitely a major agricultural region, especially for tea, fruits, and vegetables. However, the Kura River basin is also a key area. But the question is about a region. In terms of administrative regions, the Kura River flows through several regions, including Ganja, Shusha, and others. But perhaps the answer is the Kura River basin.",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the typical age at which children become independent from their parents in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic. 

First, I know that the age of independence can vary widely based on cultural, economic, and social factors. In some countries, it's common for children to leave home around 18, while in others, they might stay longer. 

Azerbaijan is a country in the South Caucasus region. I remember that in many Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, there's a strong emphasis on family ties, and children might stay with their parents longer. However, I'm not entirely sure about Azerbaijan specifically. 

I should consider factors like education, employment opportunities, and societal norms. In Azerbaijan, the legal age of majority is 18, which means that at 18, individuals are considered legally adults. However, becoming independent isn't just about legal age; it's also about being able to support oneself financially. 

I might need to check if there are any cultural practices or traditions in Azerbaijan that influence when children move out. For example, in some cultures, it's common for children to stay until they get married, which might be around 20-25 years old. However, in urban areas, the trend might be towards leaving home earlier, especially with higher education and more job opportunities. 

I should also think about economic factors. If the economy is strong and there are good job prospects, young adults might be able to move out sooner. Conversely, if the economy is struggling, they might need to stay longer to help the family or due to lack of opportunities. 

Another angle is education. If higher education is common and takes longer, like university studies lasting four years, then students might stay at home during their studies and leave after graduation, which would be around 22-23 years old. 

I'm not sure if there's a specific average age cited in studies or reports. I might need to recall any sources I've come across. For example, some articles or demographic data from the Azerbaijani government or international organizations. 

Wait, I think in some sources, the average age for leaving home in Azerbaijan is around 25. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to other post-Soviet countries, where the age might be higher than in Western countries but lower than in some Middle Eastern nations.

Okay, so the user is asking which day of the week people in Azerbaijan usually organize a family meal. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall any cultural practices in Azerbaijan related to family meals. I know that in many cultures, certain days are more significant for family gatherings. For example, in some countries, Sunday is a common day for family meals because it's a day off. However, Azerbaijan is a Muslim-majority country, so their traditions might be influenced by Islamic practices.

In Islamic culture, Friday is considered a holy day, and many Muslims attend prayers at the mosque. However, family meals might be more common on weekends. But wait, in some Middle Eastern countries, Friday is the main day for family gatherings. However, Azerbaijan is in the Caucasus region, so maybe their practices are different.

Alternatively, maybe they have a tradition of having family meals on Saturdays or Sundays. I should check if there's a specific day associated with family meals in Azerbaijani culture. Let me think about holidays or weekly traditions. 

Wait, I remember that in some parts of the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan, Saturday is considered a day for family gatherings. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: maybe looking at the work week. If the work week is Monday to Friday, then Saturday and Sunday are weekends. In some countries, Sunday is more common for family meals, but in others, Saturday. 

Alternatively, maybe it's Friday because it's a day of rest and prayer. However, I need to be precise. Let me try to recall any specific information. I think in Azerbaijan, Friday is an important day for family meals. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's Sunday. 

Wait, I found conflicting information before. Let me think again. In some sources, it's mentioned that in Azerbaijan, people often have family meals on Fridays. However, other sources might say weekends. But since the user is asking for a specific answer, I need to be accurate. 

Alternatively, maybe there's no strict rule, but the most common answer is Friday. Or perhaps it's a different day. I think I should confirm. 

Wait, I think in many Muslim countries, Friday is a day when families come together, but in Azerbaijan, maybe they have a specific tradition. Alternatively, maybe it's Saturday. 

Hmm. I think I need to go with the most commonly cited answer. From what I remember, Friday is considered a day for family meals in Azerbaijan. But I",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is a common snack for preschool kids in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what a common snack for preschool kids in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, so their food might have influences from both Middle Eastern and Central Asian cuisines.

I know that traditional Azerbaijani dishes include things like plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed grape leaves or vegetables), and various types of kebabs. However, those are more main dishes rather than snacks. For snacks, maybe they have something similar to other countries' common snacks for children.

I should consider typical snacks that are easy to prepare, portable, and not too messy for young kids. Maybe something like fruits? But the question specifies a common snack, so maybe a specific item. I remember that in some countries, cookies or pastries are common. Azerbaijan has a type of sweet called ""shekerbura,"" which are sweet pastries filled with nuts and raisins. But are those given as snacks to preschoolers?

Alternatively, maybe they have something like ""paklava,"" which is a layered pastry with nuts and syrup. However, that's more of a dessert. Another possibility is ""gözleme,"" which is a type of stuffed flatbread. But again, that's more of a main dish.

Wait, maybe it's something simpler. In many countries, sandwiches or bread with cheese or spreads are common. Azerbaijan uses lavash, a type of flatbread. Maybe a simple lavash with some cheese or butter? Or maybe a type of cookie or biscuit.

I also recall that in some regions, dried fruits or nuts are common snacks. Maybe ""badam"" (almonds) or ""hazelnuts"" are given as snacks. However, I'm not sure if that's typical for preschoolers.

Alternatively, there's a snack called ""muhallebi,"" which is a milk-based dessert, but again, that's more of a sweet. Perhaps ""qurut"" which is dried yogurt, but that's more of a dairy product.

Wait, I think I've heard of ""shish kebab"" as a snack, but that's more of a meat dish. Maybe ""samosa"" or ""puff pastry"" items? Or perhaps ""manti,"" which are dumplings, but again, that's more of a main dish.

{""question"":""What symbolic food do people from Azerbaijan eat on (Lunar) New Year?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the symbolic food that people in Azerbaijan eat during the Lunar New Year. Hmm, wait a second. Azerbaijan primarily celebrates the Solar New Year, not the Lunar one. The Lunar New Year is more associated with East Asian countries like China, Vietnam, or Korea. But maybe there's some influence or a specific dish that's eaten during their New Year celebrations, even if it's not the Lunar one.

First, I need to confirm whether Azerbaijan has any traditional foods specifically for their New Year. The Solar New Year in Azerbaijan is called Novruz, which is a big celebration. Novruz is celebrated on the spring equinox, usually around March 20th or 21st. During Novruz, there are several symbolic foods. For example, ""sumalak"" is a wheat-based dish that's cooked over several days and is a staple. Also, ""pilaf"" (rice dish) is common, and ""gazma"" (a type of pancake) is eaten on the first day. But these are for Novruz, not the Lunar New Year.

Wait, the question specifically mentions (Lunar) New Year. Since Azerbaijan doesn't traditionally observe the Lunar New Year, maybe there's a confusion here. However, if there's any adoption of Lunar New Year traditions, perhaps due to cultural exchange or in diaspora communities, but I'm not aware of any specific Azerbaijani dish associated with Lunar New Year. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the general New Year (January 1st), but even then, the traditional foods are more related to Novruz.

So, the answer might be that there isn't a specific symbolic food for the Lunar New Year in Azerbaijan because they don't celebrate it. However, if the user is referring to their own New Year (Novruz), then the answer would be sumalak, pilaf, or gazma. But since the question mentions Lunar New Year, which is not part of Azerbaijani tradition, perhaps the answer is that there is no symbolic food for Lunar New Year in Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe they eat similar foods as in other cultures, but I don't have information on that. I need to make sure I'm not conflating Novruz with Lunar New Year. The user might have made a mistake in the question, but I should answer based on the given information. Since the question is about Lunar New Year, and Azerbaijan doesn't have that tradition, the answer is that they don",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What religion is mainly taught in schools in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking what religion is mainly taught in schools in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Azerbaijan is a secular country, but the majority of the population is Muslim. However, the education system might have specific policies. I remember that Azerbaijan has a constitution that separates religion from the state, so schools might not promote any specific religion. But then again, maybe they teach about the predominant religion as part of cultural or history classes.

Wait, I should check if there's any official curriculum. From what I recall, the main religion in Azerbaijan is Islam, specifically Shia Islam, but the government doesn't enforce religious education. However, there might be some religious studies in schools, but not as a main subject. Alternatively, maybe they teach about the country's religious heritage without promoting a specific faith.

Also, the country has a significant number of people who identify as Muslim, but the government has been promoting secularism. So perhaps the answer is that Islam is the main religion taught, but it's not as a religious instruction. Or maybe they don't teach a specific religion, but the predominant one is Islam in the context of culture and history.

Wait, maybe the answer is that while schools are secular, Islamic culture and history are taught as part of the curriculum, making Islam the main religion associated with education. But I need to confirm if there's a specific subject that teaches religion. Alternatively, maybe there's no main religion taught, but the majority of students are Muslim, so the primary religion in the country is Islam, even if not formally taught in schools.

Hmm, I think the key point is that Azerbaijan's education system is secular, so they don't teach a specific religion as a main subject. However, the predominant religion in the country is Islam, so it's possible that the answer is Islam, even if it's not the main subject taught. But I need to be accurate. Let me recall some sources. According to various references, Azerbaijan's schools do not have religious instruction as part of the curriculum. Instead, they teach about the country's religious heritage, which includes Islam, but it's not a main subject. However, the question is about what religion is ""mainly taught,"" which might refer to the predominant religion in the country, even if not formally taught in schools.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific religious education. Wait, in some countries, even if secular, they might have courses on religion. But in Azerbaijan, the government has historically promoted secularism. So",1,,,,

Okay, so the user is asking which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Azerbaijan attend most frequently. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about education in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has a system where students can attend both public and private schools. Private institutes might focus on specific subjects or offer specialized programs. 

I remember that in many countries, subjects like math, science, or languages are popular for private tutoring or specialized academies. But I need to be specific to Azerbaijan. 

Wait, there's a well-known private education institution in Azerbaijan called ""Azerbaijan International School"" or maybe ""Baku International School,"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, there might be institutes focused on preparing students for entrance exams, like those for university admission. 

Another angle: the most common subjects students might need extra help with. In many places, math and science are common because they're foundational for university entrance. Also, English language is often emphasized in Azerbaijan due to its importance in higher education and international opportunities. 

But the question is about the subject's academy or private institute. So, maybe there are academies specifically for math, physics, or computer science. Alternatively, institutes that offer specialized programs beyond the standard curriculum. 

I think in Azerbaijan, the most frequent private institutes might be those focused on mathematics and science, as these are common areas where students seek additional training. Another possibility is language institutes, especially for English, given the country's focus on improving English proficiency.

Wait, I should check if there's any data or reports on this. But since I can't access external information, I have to rely on existing knowledge. 

In many countries, private tutoring centers are most common for subjects like math, science, and languages. Considering the competitive exam system in Azerbaijan, students might attend private institutes for subjects that are crucial for entrance exams. 

So, putting it all together, the most frequent subjects would be mathematics and science, possibly including physics and computer science. Alternatively, it might be English language institutes. But I think math is a strong candidate. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""mathematics and science"" as a combined answer. However, the user wants a single answer in a list. Maybe the most common is mathematics. Or perhaps there's a specific institute known for a particular subject.

{""question"":""Which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about Azerbaijan's education system. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their education system is influenced by both Soviet-era structures and more recent reforms. In many countries, subjects like mathematics, science, and languages are often emphasized, especially if they're important for higher education or career opportunities.

I remember that in Azerbaijan, the national language is Azerbaijani, and there's a strong emphasis on learning Russian as well, given historical ties with Russia. However, the most important subject might vary based on cultural, economic, and governmental priorities.

Looking at the curriculum, core subjects usually include mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, literature, history, and foreign languages. But which one is considered the most important? In many countries, mathematics is fundamental because it's a prerequisite for many fields like engineering, technology, and sciences. However, in some contexts, subjects like history or national identity might be prioritized.

Wait, but in Azerbaijan, there might be a focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) due to economic development goals. Alternatively, since the country has been investing in higher education and technical fields, maybe subjects like mathematics or computer science are emphasized.

Alternatively, considering the national exams, the Unified State Examination (USE) in Azerbaijan includes subjects like Azerbaijani language, mathematics, and foreign languages. But is there a subject that's given more weight in terms of importance for university admissions or career paths?

I should also consider any recent policies. For example, if the government is pushing for digital transformation, computer science might be more important. However, traditionally, mathematics is often seen as a key subject because it's foundational for many other disciplines.

Another angle: in many educational systems, the subject that's most important can be the one that's required for the most university programs. In Azerbaijan, mathematics is often a required subject for engineering, economics, and other fields, which might make it the most important.

But I'm not entirely sure. I need to verify if there's any official data or surveys indicating which subject is prioritized. However, without specific data, I have to rely on general knowledge. In countries with a strong emphasis on STEM, math is often considered crucial. Given Azerbaijan's focus on developing its tech sector and education reforms, it's possible that mathematics is the most important subject.

{""question"":""What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what food items people in Azerbaijan typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine and drinking habits.

First, Azerbaijan is a country with a rich culinary tradition influenced by its location between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, as well as its history with Persian and Central Asian cuisines. They have a variety of dishes, including grilled meats, pilafs, and various pastries. 

Now, when it comes to pairing food with hard liquor, which in this context might refer to spirits like vodka, brandy, or other strong alcoholic drinks. In many cultures, strong spirits are paired with salty, fatty, or spicy foods to balance the flavors. 

In Azerbaijan, I remember that they have a dish called ""dolma,"" which is grape leaves stuffed with rice and meat. That's quite common. Also, ""pilaf"" is a staple, usually with lamb or chicken. Then there's ""kufte,"" which are meatballs, sometimes served with a spicy sauce. 

Another thing is that they might have appetizers or meze-style dishes. For example, ""khash"" is a traditional soup made from cow's feet, but that's more of a hearty dish, maybe not typically paired with hard liquor. 

Cheeses are also common in Azerbaijan, like ""tirkiye"" cheese, which is a salty, brined cheese. That could pair well with strong drinks. Also, they have various types of bread, like lavash, which is flatbread. Maybe they use it to soak up the liquor, similar to how some cultures use bread with strong drinks.

I should also consider if there are any specific dishes that are traditionally served with alcohol. For example, in some countries, pickled vegetables or onions are served with vodka. Maybe Azerbaijan has similar items. 

Another angle: during social gatherings or celebrations, they might serve dishes that are rich and flavorful. So, perhaps dishes like ""shish kebab"" (grilled meat skewers) or ""qovurma"" (a type of meat dish). Also, ""solyuk"" is a stewed meat dish, which could be heavy and paired with something strong.

But I need to make sure these are actually paired with hard liquor, not just typical dishes. Maybe looking into specific traditions or common practices. For example, in some regions, they might have a particular way of serving spirits with certain foods.

{""question"":""What is the most popular indoor sport in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, and they have a rich cultural heritage. I know that football (soccer) is popular there, but I'm not sure if it's considered an indoor sport. Wait, football is usually played outdoors on a field.

Indoor sports would be things like basketball, volleyball, maybe table tennis or badminton. But I need to check which of these is the most popular in Azerbaijan. Let me think about the country's sports culture. Azerbaijan has a strong presence in combat sports like wrestling, but that's usually outdoor or in arenas. However, wrestling might be more traditional than indoor.

I remember that Azerbaijan has had some success in sports like judo and boxing, but again, those are typically in gyms or arenas, which could be considered indoor. But perhaps the most popular indoor sport would be something more widely followed by the general public. Maybe basketball? I think they have a national basketball team, but I'm not sure about its popularity compared to other sports.

Alternatively, maybe chess? Azerbaijan has produced some strong chess players, like Teimour Radjabov. But chess is more of a mind sport, not a physical one. However, it's definitely played indoors. But is it the most popular?

Wait, I should check if there are any statistics or common knowledge about this. From what I recall, in many countries, basketball is a popular indoor sport, especially in regions where outdoor sports might be limited by climate. Azerbaijan has a varied climate, but maybe indoor sports are more accessible in cities.

Another angle: looking at the sports infrastructure. If Azerbaijan has a lot of indoor sports facilities, that might indicate which sports are popular. For example, if there are many basketball courts or volleyball halls, that could be a clue.

Alternatively, looking at the national teams and media coverage. If a particular indoor sport gets a lot of media attention or has successful teams, that might indicate popularity. For example, if Azerbaijan's basketball team participates in international competitions and is well-supported, that could be a sign.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about other factors. In some countries, table tennis is popular, but I don't know about Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe volleyball is more common in certain regions.

Wait, I found in some previous knowledge that Azerbaijan has a strong tradition in wrestling, but that's not an indoor",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What are the most popular sweets in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular sweets in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that Azerbaijani cuisine has a lot of influences from Persian and Turkish cuisines, so maybe some of their sweets are similar.

First, there's baklava. I think that's a common sweet in many Middle Eastern and Caucasus countries. It's made with layers of phyllo dough and nuts, usually. So that's probably a popular one.

Then there's gozleme, but wait, isn't that more of a savory dish? Maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me check. No, gozleme is usually filled with meat or cheese, so maybe not a sweet. Maybe I should think of something else.

Another one is halva. I think halva is a popular sweet in many places, like in the Middle East and Central Asia. It's made from tahini or sesame paste, sometimes with honey. That's likely a favorite in Azerbaijan too.

What about shekerbura? I've heard that term before. It's a type of sweet dumpling filled with nuts and sugar, wrapped in a dough. Yes, that's a traditional Azerbaijani sweet. So that should be on the list.

Then there's qurut, but isn't that more of a dried dairy product? Maybe not a sweet. Maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Let me think again.

Shirin pilaf? Wait, pilaf is a rice dish, but maybe there's a sweet version. I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a dessert called ""shirin"" which means sweet in Persian. Maybe not.

Another possibility is ""muhallebi,"" which is a milk-based dessert, similar to custard. I think that's popular in the region. So that's another one.

Also, ""tutmaq"" is a type of sweet roll, sometimes filled with jam or nuts. I think that's a traditional sweet in Azerbaijan.

Wait, I should make sure these are actually popular in Azerbaijan. Let me think of some other sources. I recall that Azerbaijani sweets often include nuts, honey, and dried fruits. So maybe ""pilaf"" isn't a sweet, but ""shirin pilaf"" might be a sweet dish. Alternatively, maybe ""shirin"" is a type of dessert.

Alternatively, ""sahlab"" is a dessert made from orch",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which job is considered underpaid in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which job is considered underpaid in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about the economy and employment situation there.

Azerbaijan has a mix of industries, including oil and gas, which are major contributors to the economy. However, the country also has a significant agricultural sector and some manufacturing. But when it comes to underpaid jobs, I remember hearing that public sector jobs, especially in government positions, might not offer competitive salaries. Also, maybe teaching or healthcare roles in rural areas could be underpaid. 

Wait, I should check if there are specific reports or surveys about this. From what I've read before, in many countries, teachers, healthcare workers, and public servants often have lower pay compared to private sector jobs. In Azerbaijan, the government has been trying to improve salaries, but there might still be disparities. 

Another angle: the informal sector might have low wages, but those aren't always considered formal jobs. Maybe jobs in certain industries like construction or manual labor are underpaid, but I'm not sure if that's the case specifically in Azerbaijan. 

I think the most commonly cited underpaid jobs in Azerbaijan are those in the public sector, such as teachers, doctors, or government employees. However, I need to confirm if there's a specific job that's most frequently mentioned. 

Wait, I recall that in recent years, there have been discussions about low wages for teachers and healthcare workers. But maybe the answer is more specific. Let me think again. 

In some sources, it's mentioned that despite the country's oil wealth, many public sector jobs don't reflect that wealth in terms of salaries. So perhaps the answer is public sector jobs, but the user wants a single job. Hmm, maybe the answer is ""public sector jobs"" but the user might expect a more specific role. Alternatively, maybe ""teacher"" or ""healthcare worker."" 

But without specific data, it's hard to be certain. However, based on common knowledge, public sector jobs in Azerbaijan are often considered underpaid compared to the private sector, especially in oil and gas. So the answer might be public sector jobs. However, the user might want a specific job title. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""teacher"" as a common example. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the lack of specific data, I think the safest answer based on general knowledge is that public sector jobs are considered underpaid in Azerbaijan. However, the user might want a single job.

{""question"":""Which food is a cost-effective and quick meal option in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about a cost-effective and quick meal option in Azerbaijan. Let me think about Azerbaijani cuisine. They have a lot of dishes that are traditional and might be affordable.

First, I should consider common street foods or dishes that are quick to prepare. Plov is a staple, but maybe it's more of a main dish and could take time to cook. Then there's dolma, which is stuffed grape leaves, but that might require more preparation.

Wait, there's a dish called ""pilaf"" which is similar to plov, but maybe not as quick. What about ""khinkali""? No, those are dumplings and might not be the quickest. 

Oh, ""lagman"" is a noodle dish, but it's usually served in restaurants. Maybe ""shish kebab"" is quick, but that's more of a street food and might vary in price. 

Wait, there's a dish called ""pogaca"" which is a type of bread, but that's more of a snack. 

Wait, maybe ""manti"" (dumplings) are quick to eat but might not be the most cost-effective. 

Alternatively, ""dolma"" is often served as a side or main, but again, preparation time. 

Wait, ""shashlik"" is grilled meat, which is popular and could be quick if you're buying it ready. But is it cost-effective?

Wait, ""kufte"" are meatballs, but again, cooking time. 

Alternatively, maybe ""plov"" is actually the most common and can be found in many places, maybe even pre-cooked. But is it quick? If you're buying it from a vendor, maybe yes. 

But the user wants a single answer. Let me check online. Wait, I can't access the internet, but based on knowledge. In Azerbaijan, ""plov"" is a national dish, made with rice, meat, and vegetables. It's often sold in markets or street vendors, and it's a staple, so it's likely cost-effective and quick to eat once purchased. Alternatively, ""dolma"" is another possibility, but maybe not as quick. 

Alternatively, ""gazlama"" is a type of bread, but not a meal. 

Wait, ""shorba"" is a soup, but that might take time.

{""question"":""What are the family-related holidays in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the family-related holidays in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani holidays. The main public holidays in Azerbaijan include New Year's Day, which is on January 1st, and Christmas, but I think Christmas isn't widely celebrated there since it's a predominantly Muslim country. Then there's the Nowruz festival, which is a big one. Nowruz is the Persian New Year, celebrated on March 21st, and it's a time for family gatherings, so that's definitely family-related.

Next, the Independence Day of Azerbaijan is on October 18th, which commemorates the country's independence from the Soviet Union. That's a national holiday, but I'm not sure if it's specifically family-oriented. Then there's the Day of the Army, which is in January, but again, that's more about military service.

Wait, there's also the Defender of the Fatherland Day on February 15th, which honors those who serve in the military. Maybe families have gatherings on that day. But I'm not certain if it's considered a family holiday per se.

Another one is the Spring Equinox, which is part of Nowruz. Also, the Victory Day on May 9th commemorates the end of World War II. Again, more of a national holiday than family-focused.

I should check if there are any specific holidays that are about family units, like a Family Day or something similar. But I don't recall Azerbaijan having such a holiday. The main family-related ones would likely be Nowruz, New Year's, and maybe Independence Day, but I think the primary one is Nowruz. Also, the start of the new year in the traditional calendar, which is Nowruz, is a big family event with feasts and gatherings. So the answer would include Nowruz, New Year's Day, and maybe Independence Day, but I need to confirm if those are considered family-related.

Wait, the user asked for family-related holidays. So, Nowruz is definitely family-oriented. New Year's Day (January 1st) is also a time for family gatherings. Then there's the Day of the Family, but I don't think that's an official holiday in Azerbaijan. Maybe the Defender of the Fatherland Day, but that's more about military service. So the main ones are Nowruz, New Year's Day, and perhaps the Independence Day. However, I need to make sure. Maybe the main answer is",1,,,,

{""question"":""What are popular snacks in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what popular snacks are in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that they have a lot of dishes influenced by Persian and Turkish cuisines. Common ingredients include things like yogurt, rice, and various meats.

First, I should think about traditional snacks. There's plov, which is a rice dish, but is that considered a snack or a main meal? Maybe not a snack. Then there's dolma, which are stuffed vegetables or grape leaves. Those are usually served as appetizers or side dishes, so maybe they count as snacks.

Another thing is paklava, which is a sweet pastry. That's more of a dessert, but sometimes people might eat it as a snack. Then there's chai, the tea, which is often accompanied by snacks. But the question is about snacks, not drinks.

I've heard of something called ""sığır çörəyi"" which is beef soup, but that's a main dish. Maybe there are specific snacks like ""sədərək"" which is a type of sweet roll. Or ""qoz"" which is a type of pancake. Wait, qoz is more of a breakfast item, but maybe it's also eaten as a snack.

There's also ""məmməd qız"", which is a type of cheese. Maybe that's a snack. Also, ""tərəvizli pilaf"" is a vegetable pilaf, but again, that's a main dish. 

I think I should check if there are any specific snacks that are commonly sold in markets or street food. Maybe ""manti"" which are dumplings, but those are usually eaten as a meal. ""Lavash"" is flatbread, which might be used as a wrap for snacks. 

Wait, ""pilav"" is rice, but again, not sure if it's a snack. Maybe ""sədərək"" is a better fit. Also, ""qara qoz"" which is black pancakes. 

I think I need to list the most commonly recognized snacks. So, putting it all together, the popular snacks might include dolma, paklava, sədərək, qara qoz, and maybe some types of cheese or pastries. Let me make sure I'm not confusing main dishes with snacks. I'll go with dolma, paklava, sədə",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""Which professional sport is the highest paying in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which professional sport is the highest paying in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Azerbaijan. The country has a strong tradition in certain sports, especially in combat sports like wrestling and boxing. They've had notable athletes in these areas.

But the question is about which sport is the highest paying. Pay in sports can depend on factors like sponsorship deals, prize money, media rights, and the popularity of the sport. In many countries, sports like football (soccer) are the highest paying because of the massive global audience and commercialization. However, in Azerbaijan, maybe it's different.

I remember that Azerbaijan has a strong presence in sports such as weightlifting, judo, and boxing. They've had successful athletes in these disciplines. Also, the country has invested in sports infrastructure, maybe more in certain areas. However, professional leagues in these sports might not be as lucrative as football leagues in other countries.

Wait, but in Azerbaijan, football is a popular sport. The Azerbaijan Premier League is the top football league. However, compared to other countries, maybe the salaries aren't as high as in Europe. But perhaps other sports have higher earnings for top athletes. For example, if an athlete wins medals in the Olympics or World Championships, they might get significant rewards from the government or sponsors.

Another angle: combat sports like boxing or wrestling might have high-profile athletes who earn a lot through fights, sponsorships, and endorsements. For example, if there's a famous boxer from Azerbaijan, they might be among the highest earners. However, in some countries, football players earn more due to club contracts.

I should also consider if there are any other sports that are popular and have high-paying opportunities. Maybe sports like motorsports or basketball, but I'm not sure about their presence in Azerbaijan.

Looking up some information in my mind: Azerbaijan has had success in weightlifting, with athletes like Iryna Klymchenko, but I don't know about their earnings. In boxing, there's been a boxer named Mammad Azizov, but again, not sure about his earnings compared to others.

Another thought: in some countries, sports like wrestling have high pay due to national pride and government support. If the government invests in certain sports, athletes might receive substantial funding or rewards for their achievements.

Alternatively, maybe the highest paying sport is not a team sport but an individual one where top athletes can earn through competitions and endorsements. However, without specific data, it's",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular winter sport in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular winter sport in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, bordered by Russia, Georgia, and Iran. The climate there is mostly temperate, but since it's in the northern hemisphere, they have winters.

Now, winter sports typically include things like skiing, ice hockey, figure skating, maybe snowboarding. But I need to find out which one is the most popular in Azerbaijan specifically. I don't know much about their sports culture. Maybe I should think about their geography. Do they have mountains where skiing is possible? The Caucasus Mountains are nearby, so maybe there are ski resorts. If there are ski resorts, then skiing might be a popular sport there.

Alternatively, maybe ice hockey is popular because it's a team sport and can be played in rinks. But I'm not sure. I should check if Azerbaijan has a national team or notable athletes in any winter sports. I know that some countries in the region might not have a strong tradition in winter sports, but maybe they participate in the Winter Olympics. Let me think, Azerbaijan has participated in the Winter Olympics, right? For example, in 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022. Their athletes compete in sports like alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, etc.

But which one is the most popular? Maybe skiing in general, but I need to be specific. Wait, I remember that Azerbaijan has a ski resort called Shahdag. Shahdag is a mountain in the Greater Caucasus, and there's a ski resort there. That might be a place where people go skiing, so that could be a clue. If there's a ski resort, then alpine skiing might be the most popular winter sport there.

Another angle: maybe ice hockey is popular, but I don't recall Azerbaijan having a strong ice hockey presence. Maybe figure skating? But again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe winter sports aren't as popular in Azerbaijan because the country is more known for other sports like wrestling, football, or boxing. But the question specifically asks for the most popular winter sport.

{""question"":""What is the most popular water sport in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this question about the most popular water sport in Azerbaijan. First, I need to recall what I know about Azerbaijan's geography and culture. Azerbaijan is a country located on the Caspian Sea, which is the largest inland body of water in the world. The Caspian Sea is a significant part of the country's landscape, so it's likely that water sports related to it are popular.

Now, thinking about common water sports, there's sailing, fishing, swimming, maybe even water skiing or jet skiing. But I need to figure out which one is the most popular. Since the Caspian Sea is a major feature, perhaps sailing or fishing could be contenders. However, I remember that in some countries, fishing is a traditional activity, but whether it's considered a sport might vary. Sailing could be more of a recreational activity. 

Wait, I should check if there are any notable events or sports teams in Azerbaijan related to water sports. For example, maybe they have a national sailing team or participate in international competitions. Alternatively, maybe the government promotes certain sports. Another angle: the population's access to water bodies. The Caspian Sea is long, so coastal areas might have more opportunities for water sports. 

I also need to consider if there are other water sports that might be more popular. For example, in some countries, windsurfing or kite surfing might be popular if the coastal conditions are right. But I don't recall specific information about Azerbaijan having those. 

Another thought: maybe the answer is fishing. In many countries, fishing is a popular pastime, and it's often considered a sport. If the Caspian Sea has a lot of fish, like sturgeon, which is known in the Caspian region, then fishing might be a significant activity. However, I'm not sure if it's classified as a sport or just a traditional practice. 

Alternatively, maybe sailing is the answer. Azerbaijan has a sailing club, and they might participate in regattas. I think the country has a national sailing team. So perhaps sailing is the most popular water sport. 

But how to confirm? Since I can't look it up, I have to rely on existing knowledge. Another angle: the country's Olympic participation. If Azerbaijan has athletes in sailing events, that might indicate popularity. For example, they have had sailors in the Olympics. 

Alternatively, maybe it's not a sport but a recreational activity. However, the question specifies a water sport, so",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which cities or regions are known for their import and export activities in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which cities or regions in Azerbaijan are known for their import and export activities. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's economy and geography.

Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, with a significant oil and gas industry. Their economy relies heavily on exports of oil and natural gas. The main port for exports would probably be in the Caspian Sea, since they don't have access to the Black Sea directly. I remember that Baku is the capital and the largest city, so that's likely a key center for trade. 

Baku is also home to the Baku Port, which handles a lot of cargo, especially oil. Then there's the pipeline infrastructure, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which exports oil to the Mediterranean. So Baku must be a major player here.

Another region might be the Ganja region. Ganja is a large city in the central part of the country, and I think it's a significant industrial and commercial hub. It might have markets for agricultural products and other goods. Also, the region around the Caspian Sea, maybe the Absheron Peninsula, since that's where Baku is located and has the oil fields.

Then there's the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, but I'm not sure about its role in trade. It's more of a mountainous area, maybe less involved in import/export. The Lankaran region might be important for agriculture, exporting fruits and vegetables, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the Heydar Aliyev Port in Baku is a major seaport for the Caspian Sea, so that's a key point. Also, the city of Sumgait is known for its chemical industry and might be involved in trade. But I'm not sure if it's as prominent as Baku.

So putting it together, the main cities would be Baku, Ganja, and maybe the Absheron Peninsula. I should check if there are other regions. The Astrakhan region is in Russia, not Azerbaijan, so that's not relevant. 

I think the answer would be Baku, Ganja, and Absheron Peninsula. Let me confirm: Baku is definitely the main one, Ganja as a commercial hub, and Absheron for oil exports. Maybe also the port of Lankaran, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Caspian Sea region in general. The answer should list the",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about the education system there.

First, Azerbaijan follows a system that's similar to other countries in the region. Middle school in Azerbaijan typically refers to the secondary education stage, which is usually grades 6 to 9. Now, the number of subjects can vary depending on the curriculum, which might be influenced by the national education standards set by the government.

I remember that in many countries, middle school subjects include core areas like mathematics, science, language, social studies, physical education, and arts. However, the exact number can differ. For example, some countries might have more specialized subjects or combine certain areas.

I should check if there's an official source or a reliable educational resource that lists the subjects taught in Azerbaijani middle schools. Since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I recall, the Azerbaijani curriculum includes a variety of subjects. Let me list them out mentally:

- Azerbaijani language and literature
- Mathematics
- Foreign languages (like English, Russian)
- History of Azerbaijan and World History
- Geography
- Physics and Chemistry (maybe combined)
- Biology
- Physical Education
- Music and Art
- Information Technology
- Civic Education or Moral Education
- Maybe some technical subjects or electives

Wait, but how many is that? Let me count. If each of these is a separate subject, that's around 12. But I might be missing some or including others. Also, sometimes subjects are combined, like a general science course covering physics and chemistry. If that's the case, the number might be less. Alternatively, there could be more subjects like computer science, or additional language options.

Another angle: the number of subjects might be standardized. For example, in some countries, middle school students take around 10-12 subjects. Considering that, and the ones I listed, 12 seems plausible. However, I'm not entirely sure.

{""question"":""What is the top university in Azerbaijan? (Provide the official name.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to find out the top university in Azerbaijan and provide its official name. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani universities. I remember that Baku is the capital, and there are several universities there.

First, there's the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University, which is known for engineering and technical fields. Then there's the Azerbaijan Medical University, which is focused on medical education. But I think the top university might be a more general one, not specialized.

Wait, I've heard of the Azerbaijan State University, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the National Academy of Sciences. No, the National Academy is a research institution. Maybe the top university is the one that's most well-regarded overall. 

Another possibility is the University of Azerbaijan. Wait, I think the official name is the Azerbaijan State University. But I need to confirm. Sometimes universities have different names in English versus their local names. Let me check in my mind: the top-ranked university in Azerbaijan according to some rankings like QS or THE. 

From what I remember, the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University is often ranked high, but maybe the top is the Azerbaijan State University. However, sometimes the top is the National University of Azerbaijan. Wait, I think the correct official name is the Azerbaijan State University, but I'm a bit confused because there's also the National Academy of Sciences. 

Alternatively, the University of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan) might be the official name. Wait, I need to be precise. Let me think again. The top university in Azerbaijan is commonly referred to as the Azerbaijan State University. However, I should verify if that's the official name. Some sources might list it as the Azerbaijan State University, while others might use the National University of Azerbaijan. 

Wait, perhaps the correct official name is the Azerbaijan State University, which is also known as the National University of Azerbaijan. But the official name might be the Azerbaijan State University. Alternatively, maybe it's called the Azerbaijan State University of Oil and Industry, but that's more specialized. 

I think the most accurate answer is that the top university is the Azerbaijan State University, also known as the National University of Azerbaijan. However, I need to ensure that the official name is the Azerbaijan State University. Alternatively, maybe it's the Azerbaijan Medical University, but that's more specialized. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall: the National University of Azerbaijan is the top one. But the official name might",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about a food that children in Azerbaijan typically dislike but the elderly enjoy. Hmm, I need to think about Azerbaijani cuisine and common preferences between different age groups.

First, I know that Azerbaijani food includes dishes like plov, dolma, kebabs, and various types of soups. But which of these might be disliked by kids? Maybe something with strong flavors or certain ingredients. For example, some traditional dishes might have a lot of garlic, herbs, or specific spices that children might find too intense.

Wait, there's a dish called ""shish kebab"" which is popular, but I don't think that's disliked by children. Another possibility is ""kufte,"" which are meatballs, but again, not sure. Maybe something more traditional or less common. Oh, there's a dish called ""tavuk qazanı,"" which is a chicken stew, but again, not sure about the age preference.

Wait, maybe something with fermented foods? Like ""shir"" or ""tahı"" (a type of fermented milk drink). But I think that's more of a dairy product. Or maybe ""mujdu"" which is a type of fermented cheese. But I'm not certain if children dislike that.

Alternatively, think about the texture or preparation. Maybe dishes that are more chewy or have certain ingredients. ""Dolma"" is stuffed grape leaves, but that's usually liked by many. What about ""pilaf"" with specific spices? Or maybe ""shorba,"" a soup. But again, not sure.

Wait, there's a dish called ""göyeböyük"" which is a type of flatbread, but I don't think that's disliked by kids. Maybe something with a strong taste like ""kashk"" (a type of sour milk or buttermilk). Or ""shir"" (buttermilk). Maybe elderly people prefer it for its tangy flavor, while children find it too sour.

Alternatively, maybe ""qurut"" (dried milk) or ""qurutlu yemek"" which is a dish with dried milk. But I'm not sure if children dislike that. Another angle: in some cultures, certain dishes are considered more for older people because of their health benefits. For example, ""shorba"" with herbs might be good for digestion, so elderly might prefer it, while kids might not like the taste.

{""question"":""What do people look forward to the most at university festivals in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people look forward to the most at university festivals in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and university events.

First, university festivals are usually social events where students come together. In many countries, these festivals include things like music, food, games, and cultural activities. But Azerbaijan has its own unique aspects. The country has a rich cultural heritage with traditions like music, dance, and cuisine. So maybe the festivals incorporate traditional elements.

I remember that Azerbaijani music, especially folk music, is very popular. Instruments like the tar, kamancha, and balala are traditional. So perhaps live performances of traditional music are a big draw. Also, there's a strong emphasis on national identity, so cultural showcases might be important.

Food is another aspect. Azerbaijani cuisine includes dishes like plov, dolma, and kebabs. At festivals, food stalls or traditional cooking demonstrations could be popular. Students might look forward to trying or sharing local dishes.

Another angle is the social aspect. University festivals are times for students to relax, socialize, and have fun. Activities like games, competitions, or dance events might be highlights. Maybe there are also guest speakers or performances by local artists, which could attract attention.

I should also consider if there are any specific festivals unique to Azerbaijani universities. For example, events celebrating national holidays or historical events might have special activities. However, the question is about what people look forward to the most in general.

Putting this together, the main points might be traditional music and dance performances, cultural exhibitions, food, and social activities. But I need to ensure these are the top priorities. Since the user wants a single answer in a list, I should pick the most significant one. However, the answer might include multiple elements. Wait, the example given in the JSON has a list with one answer. Wait, the user says ""Provide one single answer as a list form"" — maybe they mean one item in the list, but the example shows a list with one item. So the answer should be a list with one element, which is the main thing people look forward to.

But the original instruction says ""answer the following question"" and the example shows a list with one answer. So perhaps the answer is a list containing one item. But maybe the user wants multiple points, but the example shows a single item. Let me check the user's instruction again.

{""question"":""Where do high school students in Azerbaijan usually go after dinner?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out where high school students in Azerbaijan usually go after dinner. Let me start by thinking about the cultural and social norms there. Azerbaijan is a country in the South Caucasus, and their culture might have certain traditions that influence students' activities.

First, I know that in many countries, after dinner, people might go out with friends, maybe to hang out, or have some leisure activities. But I need to be specific to Azerbaijan. Let me think about possible places. Maybe they go to parks? Or maybe they have some social gatherings at home? Or perhaps they attend study sessions?

Wait, high school students often have homework, so maybe some study after dinner. But the question is about where they go, not what they do. So maybe they go to a café, a park, or a friend's house? I should also consider the time of year. In the evenings, maybe they go out for walks or to public places. Another angle: in some cultures, family time is important, so maybe they stay home. But if they're with friends, maybe they go to a local hangout spot.

I should check if there are any common places known for students. Maybe internet cafes? Or maybe they go to the streets, squares, or public areas. Also, considering the climate, in warmer months they might go to parks, and in winter maybe indoor places. However, the answer should be general. Another thought: in some countries, students might go to religious places, but I'm not sure about Azerbaijan's religious practices in that context.

Alternatively, maybe they attend extracurricular activities or clubs after dinner. But the question is about where they go, not what activities. So the answer might be a combination of places like home, parks, cafes, or friends' homes. But I need to be specific. I think the most common answer might be that they go to parks or public places to hang out with friends. Or maybe they study at home. Wait, but the question is about where they go, so if they study, that's at home. But maybe they go to a study group at a friend's house.

I need to verify. Let me think about similar countries. In Turkey, students might go to parks or cafes. In Iran, maybe they go to parks or have family time. Since Azerbaijan has a similar culture to these countries, maybe the answer is parks or public areas. Alternatively, they might go to the streets or squares. Another possibility is that they",1,,,1,1.0
