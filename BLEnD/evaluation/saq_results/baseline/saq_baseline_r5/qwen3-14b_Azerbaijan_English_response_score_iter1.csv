{""question"":""Which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Azerbaijan's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which age's birthday is celebrated the most grandly in Azerbaijan's society. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and traditions.

First, I know that in many cultures, certain ages are considered significant. For example, in some countries, turning 18 is a big deal because it's the age of majority. In others, like in some Asian cultures, 60 or 70 might be important because they mark significant life milestones or are considered lucky numbers.

Now, Azerbaijan is a country with a mix of Islamic and Turkic traditions. I remember that in some Turkic cultures, the 50th birthday is a major event. There's a term called ""Ellik"" which refers to the 50th birthday. I think in some Central Asian countries, like Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan, the 50th birthday is celebrated with great pomp and ceremony. Maybe this tradition is also present in Azerbaijan.

But wait, I should check if there's any other age that's more significant. For instance, in some Islamic cultures, the 60th birthday might be important because it's a round number and signifies a long life. However, I'm not sure if that's the case in Azerbaijan specifically.

Another angle: maybe there's a national tradition or a historical reason. For example, if there's a national holiday that coincides with a certain age, but I don't recall that. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the age when people retire. In Azerbaijan, the retirement age is around 60 for men and 55 for women, so maybe 60 is a significant age. However, retirement might not be the reason for a grand celebration, unless it's a personal milestone.

Wait, going back to the ""Ellik"" tradition. I think in Azerbaijani culture, the 50th birthday is indeed a major event. The word ""Ellik"" comes from ""elli,"" meaning 50 in Azerbaijani. There are specific customs and celebrations for this age, such as family gatherings, feasts, and sometimes even community events. It might be considered a milestone because it's halfway through a typical lifespan, or it's a time when people have achieved certain life goals.

I should also consider if there are any other significant ages. For example, 70 or 75 might be celebrated, but I don't think they are as prominent as the 50th. Also,",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking which profession is most commonly studied abroad by students from Azerbaijan. I need to figure this out.

First, I should consider the common trends in Azerbaijani students studying overseas. I remember that many countries have a high number of students going to Russia, Turkey, and other neighboring countries. But the question is about the profession, not the country.

Looking at the education system in Azerbaijan, they have strong programs in certain fields. However, when students go abroad, they might be seeking better opportunities or different specializations. I've heard that engineering is a popular field. Also, medicine might be another one because of the demand for doctors in Azerbaijan. But I'm not sure which is more common.

Wait, I think there's a lot of Azerbaijani students studying in Russia, especially in technical fields. Maybe engineering or IT? Or perhaps business and management? Alternatively, maybe they go for more specialized fields like petroleum engineering since Azerbaijan has oil and gas resources. That could be a possibility.

Another angle: some sources mention that Azerbaijani students often study in countries like Turkey, Georgia, and Russia. In Turkey, for example, they might pursue engineering or business. But I need to find the most common profession across all countries.

I recall reading that many Azerbaijani students go abroad for medicine, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they study in fields like computer science or engineering because those are in demand in the job market. However, another thought: maybe law or economics? Or perhaps they go for more specialized fields like architecture?

Wait, maybe the most common is engineering. Or perhaps it's business administration. I need to check if there's a common answer here. Alternatively, maybe it's in the field of IT or computer science, given the global demand for tech professionals. But I'm not sure about Azerbaijan's specific data.

Alternatively, considering the number of scholarships or programs available. For example, the Erasmus program might have certain fields. However, I think the top answer here is likely engineering, but I'm not 100% certain. Another source might say medicine. Hmm.

Wait, I think I've seen statistics where Azerbaijani students frequently study in Russia for engineering disciplines. So perhaps engineering is the most common. Alternatively, maybe it's petroleum engineering due to the country's oil industry. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, business and management could be popular because of the need for business skills. But I need to",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most preferred recreational facility among children in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most preferred recreational facility among children in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan. It's a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of urban and rural areas. The capital is Baku, which is a major city.

Recreational facilities for children could include things like parks, playgrounds, sports centers, amusement parks, or maybe places like zoos or museums. But the question is about the most preferred one. I should consider factors like availability, cultural preferences, and maybe government initiatives.

I know that in many countries, playgrounds and parks are popular because they're accessible and allow outdoor activities. Azerbaijan might have public parks that are commonly used. Also, there might be sports facilities like football fields or basketball courts, especially if sports are a big part of the culture. However, I'm not sure if there's a specific facility that's more preferred than others.

I should check if there are any notable parks or recreational areas in Azerbaijan. For example, the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku is a modern cultural complex, but that's more for adults. Maybe there are children's parks or amusement parks. I recall that there's a place called ""Geydar Aliyev Park"" or something similar, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe outdoor sports facilities are more popular.

Another angle: in some countries, video game arcades or internet cafes are popular among children, but that might not be the case in Azerbaijan. Also, considering the economic aspects, if the country has a lot of public parks or if private facilities are more common.

Wait, I found some information in my memory that Azerbaijan has been developing its public spaces, including parks and recreational areas for children. For example, the ""Nizami Gardens"" in Baku are a historic park that might be used by children. However, I'm not sure if that's the most preferred. Alternatively, maybe children prefer modern playgrounds with equipment like swings, slides, etc.

Another thought: in some regions, zoos or aquariums might be popular. However, I don't know if there's a specific one in Azerbaijan that's especially preferred by children. Also, considering the climate, Azerbaijan has a varied climate, but in cities, it's probably temperate. So outdoor facilities would be accessible for part of the year.

I think the safest answer, based on common trends, is that playgrounds or public parks are the most preferred recreational facilities for",1,,,1,0.3333333333333333

{""question"":""What do people from Azerbaijan eat in Eid ul Fitr?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people in Azerbaijan eat during Eid ul Fitr. Let me start by recalling what Eid ul Fitr is. It's the Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting. So, during this time, people usually have special foods and feasts.

Now, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their cuisine has influences from Persian, Turkish, and Central Asian traditions. I know that in many Muslim countries, traditional dishes for Eid include sweets and pastries. For example, in Turkey, they have baklava, and in Iran, there's a variety of sweets like halva.

But specifically for Azerbaijan, I should think about their national dishes. I remember that plov is a staple in Azerbaijani cuisine. Plov is a rice dish with meat, carrots, and sometimes other vegetables, cooked together. It's a common dish for celebrations. Also, there's a dessert called shorgo, which is a sweet made from wheat, nuts, and honey. That might be eaten during Eid.

Another thing is that during Eid, families often prepare traditional sweets and pastries. Maybe something like paklava, which is similar to baklava but might have regional variations. Also, there's a dish called gozleme, which is a type of stuffed flatbread. However, I'm not sure if that's specifically for Eid or just a general dish.

I should also consider that in Azerbaijan, they might have specific dishes for the holiday. Maybe there's a type of meat dish, like kebabs, but I think plov is more likely. Also, there's a dessert called ""shekerbura,"" which is a sweet roll filled with nuts and raisins. That could be part of the Eid meal.

Wait, I need to make sure these are actually eaten during Eid ul Fitr. Since Eid is a time for feasting, it's probable that these traditional dishes are part of the celebrations. So compiling the list: plov, shorgo, paklava, shekerbura. Maybe also other sweets like halva or candies. But I should check if these are specifically associated with Eid in Azerbaijan.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific dish called ""sahlab"" or something else, but I'm not certain. To be safe, I'll go with the ones I'm more confident about: plov, shorgo, paklava, shekerbura. Let me confirm",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What sports do parents and children commonly play together in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what sports parents and children commonly play together in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and sports.

First, Azerbaijan is a country with a rich tradition in various sports. I know that they have a strong presence in sports like wrestling, especially Freestyle wrestling, which is quite popular there. But is that something parents and kids do together? Maybe not sure. Then there's chess. I remember that Azerbaijan has produced some top chess players, and chess is often played in families, so maybe that's a possibility.

Another thought: traditional games. Maybe something like Sepak Takraw, but I'm not sure if that's common in Azerbaijan. Wait, maybe it's more of a Southeast Asian sport. What about folk games? Maybe something like ""Köknörf"" which is a traditional Azerbaijani sport, but I'm not certain if it's played by families.

Then there's football (soccer). It's very popular in Azerbaijan, and kids often play football with their parents. That's a common activity. Also, maybe basketball or volleyball, but I'm not sure how common those are in family settings.

Another angle: looking at family-oriented sports. Sports that are easy to play together, like badminton or table tennis. But I don't know if that's specific to Azerbaijan. Maybe they have local sports or games that are more family-oriented.

Wait, I should check if there are any specific sports promoted in Azerbaijan for families. Maybe the government or local communities encourage certain activities. Also, considering the climate, outdoor sports might be more common. Maybe something like hiking or cycling, but that's more individual.

Wait, I think I remember that in some parts of the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan, people play a game called ""Köynək"" which is a traditional wrestling game, but again, not sure if it's a family activity.

Alternatively, maybe they play traditional games like ""Tug of War"" or ""Kubb"" (though Kubb is more Scandinavian). Or maybe ""Buzkashi"" but that's more of a horseback sport and probably not for children.

Another thought: chess is definitely something that could be played by parents and kids together, given its popularity in the country. Also, maybe check if there are any sports festivals or events where families participate together.

Wait, I think I've read that in Azerbaijan, families might engage in sports like wrestling, but maybe more in a competitive setting",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, I need to figure out the most popular extracurricular social event at schools in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's culture and education system.

Azerbaijan has a rich cultural heritage with traditions that include music, dance, and festivals. Schools often incorporate these elements into their activities. Extracurricular events could range from sports to arts. But the question is about the most popular social event, which would be something that brings students together in a social setting.

I remember that in many countries, cultural festivals or competitions are common. Maybe something like a cultural day or a festival where students showcase traditional music, dance, or crafts. Also, considering the influence of the Soviet era, there might be events related to national holidays or historical events. However, the user is asking for a specific type of event that's popular now.

Another angle: sports events are common in schools worldwide. But the question specifies a social event, which might lean more towards cultural or community-based activities rather than purely athletic. However, sports days or tournaments could still be considered social events.

Wait, I've heard about ""Köçək"" which is a traditional Azerbaijani dance, but is that an event? Or maybe ""Heydar Aliyev"" related events, but that's more political. Alternatively, ""Novruz"" is a significant holiday in Azerbaijan, and schools might have events celebrating Novruz, which is the traditional New Year. Novruz celebrations include various activities like games, food, and cultural performances. That could be a possibility.

Alternatively, school fairs, talent shows, or inter-school competitions. But which one is the most popular? Since I don't have specific data, I need to make an educated guess based on cultural relevance. Novruz is a major holiday, so events around that time might be the most popular. However, I should verify if there's a more specific event. Another thought: in some countries, school balls or dances are popular, but I'm not sure about Azerbaijan. Alternatively, cultural festivals or days dedicated to Azerbaijani culture and traditions, which might include music, dance, and art exhibitions.

Considering that the answer needs to be in a list, and the user is expecting one answer, I think the most likely answer is that cultural festivals or events celebrating Azerbaijani traditions, possibly linked to Novruz, are the most popular. But I need to be precise. Maybe the answer is ""Novruz celebrations"" or ""cultural festivals."" However,",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular weekday evening family activity in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular weekday evening family activity is in Azerbaijan. Let me start by thinking about the culture and lifestyle there. Azerbaijan is a country in the South Caucasus, and I know that family is very important in many Middle Eastern and Central Asian cultures. 

First, I should consider common family activities that people might do in the evenings. In many places, dinner is a central activity. Maybe they have family dinners together. But is that the most popular? Or are there other activities?

I also remember that Azerbaijan has a rich tradition of music and dance. Maybe attending cultural events or performances? However, those might be more common on weekends or special occasions rather than weekday evenings.

Another possibility is going out for walks or visiting parks. But again, depending on the weather and urban vs. rural areas, that might vary. In cities like Baku, maybe people go to cafes or restaurants in the evenings. But is that considered a family activity?

I should also think about religious practices. Since Azerbaijan is predominantly Muslim, some families might observe evening prayers or have religious gatherings. But I'm not sure if that's the most common.

Looking up some sources in my mind, I recall that in many countries, especially those with strong family traditions, having dinner together is a key activity. In Azerbaijan, meals are often seen as a time for family bonding. Weekday evenings might be when families come together after work and school to eat. 

Additionally, maybe watching TV or movies at home. But that's more of a passive activity. However, if the whole family watches something together, that could be considered a family activity. But compared to dining together, which is more interactive and social, dinner might be more popular.

I should also consider if there are any specific local customs. For example, in some cultures, it's common to have tea or coffee time in the evening. In Azerbaijan, tea is a significant part of social life. Maybe having tea with family is a common activity. But is that considered an evening activity?

Wait, the question specifies ""weekday evening."" Weekdays are Monday to Friday. So, after work and school, families might have dinner. In many cultures, especially in the Middle East, dinner is a big deal and a time for family. So perhaps the most popular activity is having dinner together.

But I need to be sure. Are there any other activities that are more common? Maybe going to the mosque on Fridays, but that's a specific day. Weekdays might not",1,,,1,1.0

Okay, I need to figure out which food is commonly offered as charity in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and traditions. I remember that in many Muslim countries, certain foods are associated with charity or donations, like dates or sweets during Ramadan. But I'm not sure about Azerbaijan specifically.

Azerbaijan has a mix of Turkic, Persian, and Islamic influences. Maybe they have traditional dishes that are given as alms. I've heard of ""pilaf"" being a staple food there, but is it used for charity? Or maybe something like ""dolma,"" which is stuffed grape leaves. Wait, but those are more everyday dishes.

Another angle: in some cultures, specific foods are given during festivals or for the poor. For example, in some places, bread is a symbol of sustenance and might be offered. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they use ""paklava"" or other sweets, but I'm not sure if that's for charity.

I should check if there's a particular food associated with charity in Azerbaijan. Maybe ""shashlik"" (grilled meat) is popular, but I don't think it's specifically for charity. Alternatively, maybe ""gazma"" (a type of soup) or ""khinkali"" (dumplings). Wait, but those are more like regular meals.

Wait, I think in some Islamic traditions, dates are given as charity, especially during Ramadan. But does Azerbaijan follow that? Or perhaps they have their own local tradition. Alternatively, maybe they use ""saffron rice"" or ""shirin pilaf"" as a charitable food. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is ""pilaf"" since it's a common dish, but I need to confirm. Maybe looking up if there's a specific food item mentioned in Azerbaijani charity practices. However, since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge.

Another thought: in some countries, the poor are given bread and salt as a symbol of hospitality and charity. Maybe in Azerbaijan, it's similar. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they offer ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" as part of charitable food baskets.

Wait, I think I've heard that in Azerbaijan, people might offer ""pilaf"" as a charitable food, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe ""dolma"" is used",1,,,1,0.3333333333333333

{""question"":""What eating utensils do people commonly used in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what eating utensils are commonly used in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and dining habits. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their cuisine is influenced by both Middle Eastern and Central Asian traditions.

First, I know that in many Middle Eastern countries, people use flatbread like lavash or馕, which might be eaten with hands. But utensils are also common. Forks and knives are probably used, similar to Western countries, but maybe with some differences. I remember that in some cultures, they use a knife and fork, but the way they eat might be different. Also, in some regions, people might use spoons for certain dishes.

Wait, Azerbaijan is a Muslim-majority country, so there might be some traditions around using hands for certain foods, like eating with the right hand. However, when it comes to utensils, I think they do use forks and knives, especially in urban areas. Also, spoons are definitely used for soups and stews. Maybe they have specific dishes that require particular utensils. For example, kebabs might be eaten with a knife and fork, while rice dishes like pilaf might be eaten with a spoon or hands.

I should check if there are any traditional utensils unique to Azerbaijan. I think they might use a type of spoon called a ""çay xanı"" for drinking tea, but that's more for beverages. For eating, it's probably standard utensils. Also, considering the influence of neighboring countries like Iran and Turkey, they might use similar utensils. In Iran, people use forks and spoons, and sometimes hands for certain foods. So maybe Azerbaijan is similar.

Another point: in some cultures, they use a fork and knife together, while others might use a fork alone. In Azerbaijan, I think the common practice is to use a fork and knife, especially for main dishes. For soups and stews, a spoon would be used. Also, considering the use of hands for bread, which is a staple, they might eat bread with their hands, but other foods with utensils.

Wait, the question is about eating utensils, not necessarily hands. So the answer should list the utensils. So likely fork, knife, and spoon. Maybe also a specific type of fork or knife, but I don't recall any unique ones. So the answer would be fork, knife, and spoon. Let me confirm if there are",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Who is the most popular sportperson in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular sportsperson in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by thinking about the sports that Azerbaijan is known for. They have a strong presence in combat sports like wrestling and boxing. Then there's also chess, which is pretty popular there.

First, I remember that Azerbaijan has produced some world champions in wrestling. For example, there's Hidayat Heydarov, who's a multiple-time world champion in Greco-Roman wrestling. He's been around for a while, so maybe he's a contender. But I should check if he's still active or if there are newer athletes.

Then there's the boxing scene. Azerbaijan has had some notable boxers. For instance, Arif Gurbanov won a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics. He's pretty famous, especially after winning in Rio. But I'm not sure if he's still the most popular now. Also, there's Hasanboy Dusmatov, who's a world champion in boxing. He's younger and has been winning recently, so maybe he's gaining more popularity.

In chess, Teimour Radjabov is a grandmaster and has represented Azerbaijan in international competitions. He's been around for a while and has a good reputation, but I don't know if he's as popular as the combat sports athletes.

Another name that comes to mind is Rafael Aghayev, a wrestler who has won multiple World Championships and Olympic medals. He's been competing for a long time and has a strong legacy. However, if there's a newer athlete with recent successes, they might be more popular now.

I should also consider the current trends. Maybe the most recent Olympic or World Championship winners are more popular. For example, if someone won a gold medal in the recent Olympics, they might be the most popular. But I'm not sure about the latest events. Let me think: the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were in 2021, and Azerbaijan had some medalists then. In boxing, maybe someone like Mammad Azimov, who won a gold in 2020? Or in wrestling, maybe someone else.

Wait, Hidayat Heydarov retired a few years back, so maybe Rafael Aghayev is still active. Or maybe there's another athlete. Also, in judo, Azerbaijan has had some success. But I'm not sure about the names.

Alternatively, maybe the most popular is someone who has a large",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular traditional dessert in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that Azerbaijani food is influenced by Persian, Turkish, and Central Asian cuisines. They have a lot of dishes with nuts, fruits, and sweets.

I think there's a dessert called ""shekerbura"" or something similar. Wait, maybe ""pilaf"" is a main dish, not a dessert. Then there's ""baklava,"" but isn't that more common in Middle Eastern countries too? Maybe Azerbaijan has its own version. Another possibility is ""gogal,"" which is a type of sweet bread. Or maybe ""muhallebi,"" which is a milk-based dessert similar to pudding. 

Wait, I should check if there's a specific dessert that's most famous. I recall that ""shekerbura"" is a popular one. It's a sweet made with layers of dough, nuts, and syrup. Alternatively, ""halva"" is another sweet, but I'm not sure if it's the most popular. Maybe ""baklava"" is more well-known internationally, but in Azerbaijan, perhaps ""shekerbura"" is more traditional. 

I should also consider if there's any other dessert. There's ""sahlab,"" which is made from orchid root, but that's more of a drink. ""Qurut"" is dried milk, but that's a snack. Maybe ""goshpare"" which is a type of cheese dessert. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to narrow it down. 

Looking up in my memory, I think ""shekerbura"" is often mentioned as a traditional dessert in Azerbaijan. It's made with layers of dough, filled with nuts, and soaked in syrup. It's similar to Turkish ""shekerpare"" or ""sütlaç,"" but maybe different. Alternatively, ""muhallebi"" is a custard-like dessert. 

Wait, another thought: ""pilaf"" is a rice dish, not a dessert. ""Baklava"" is definitely a contender, but I think in Azerbaijan, they might have their own version called ""baklava"" as well. However, I'm not sure if it's the most popular.

{""question"":""What is the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking for the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Christmas isn't a widely celebrated holiday in Azerbaijan because the country is predominantly Muslim, and Christmas is a Christian holiday. However, there might be some Christmas songs that have gained popularity, maybe through cultural exchange or media.

I should check if there are any traditional Azerbaijani Christmas songs. But given the religious context, it's possible that there aren't many traditional ones. Maybe some Western Christmas songs have been adapted or translated into Azerbaijani. For example, ""Jingle Bells"" might be known, but is it the most popular?

Alternatively, there could be a specific song that's popular in Azerbaijan during the holiday season. I'm not sure. Maybe some local artists have released Christmas songs. Let me think if I've heard of any. I don't recall specific names, but perhaps ""Silent Night"" has been translated?

Wait, I should verify if there's any official data or surveys about popular Christmas songs in Azerbaijan. Since I don't have real-time data, I need to rely on existing knowledge. Considering the lack of traditional Christmas celebrations, it's possible that there isn't a single most popular song. However, the user expects an answer, so maybe the best approach is to state that Christmas isn't widely celebrated there, hence no specific popular song. But the question assumes there is one.

Alternatively, maybe ""Merry Christmas"" in Azerbaijani is commonly used, but that's a phrase, not a song. Another angle: maybe ""Feliz Navidad"" is known, but again, not sure. 

Wait, I found in some sources that ""Jingle Bells"" is sometimes mentioned as a popular Christmas song in various countries, including Azerbaijan. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe there's a local song that's popular. Without specific information, the safest answer is that there isn't a widely recognized Christmas song in Azerbaijan due to the low observance of the holiday. However, the user might expect a song name. Maybe the answer is that there isn't a specific popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan because Christmas is not widely celebrated there. But the question is phrased as if there is one. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is ""Jingle Bells"" or another common song. I need to check if there's any credible source. Since I can't access the internet, I'll have to go with the most plausible answer based on available knowledge",1,,,,

{""question"":""What sports event do people from Azerbaijan passionately support the most in international competitions?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which sports event Azerbaijanis are most passionate about in international competitions. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's sports culture.

First, Azerbaijan has a strong tradition in certain sports. I remember that their national team in football (soccer) is pretty well-known, but I'm not sure if that's the one they support the most. Then there's wrestling, maybe? I think they have a good wrestling team. Oh, and they have a strong presence in combat sports like judo and boxing. Wait, but the question is about a specific event, not the sport itself. 

Wait, maybe the European Games? Azerbaijan has hosted the European Games before, and they might support that. But the European Games are a multi-sport event, so maybe not the single most supported event. 

Another angle: looking at their Olympic history. Azerbaijan has had notable athletes in weightlifting, gymnastics, and wrestling. But again, that's sports, not events. 

Wait, the question is about an event, like a competition or tournament. Maybe the UEFA Euro? But that's football, and while they do have a national team, I'm not sure if that's the top. 

Alternatively, maybe the Asian Games? But Azerbaijan is in Europe, so they might not be as involved there. 

Wait, I think the answer might be the European Wrestling Championships. Azerbaijan has produced many world and Olympic champions in wrestling, so their people might be very passionate about that. Or perhaps the Asian Games, but I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe the Olympics themselves, but the question is about a specific event. Let me check if there's a specific event they support. 

Another thought: in the 2015 European Games held in Baku, Azerbaijan, they had a lot of support. But that's a specific event. However, the question is about international competitions, not necessarily events they host. 

Wait, I think the answer is wrestling events. Since Azerbaijan has a strong wrestling tradition, with athletes like Haji Aliyev and others. They might support wrestling competitions like the World Wrestling Championships or the Olympics' wrestling events. 

But the answer needs to be a single event. Maybe the World Wrestling Championships? Or the Olympic Games' wrestling events. Alternatively, the European Wrestling Championships. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Asian Games, but I'm not sure.

{""question"":""What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Azerbaijan's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the key milestones for children's independence from parents in Azerbaijani society. Let me start by recalling what I know about family structures and cultural norms in Azerbaijan. 

First, I know that in many cultures, the age at which children leave home varies. In some countries, it's common for young adults to stay with their parents until marriage. But I'm not sure about Azerbaijan specifically. Maybe I should consider factors like education, employment, marriage, and legal age limits.

Education is a big part of childhood. In Azerbaijan, children typically start primary school at age 6 or 7. They go through secondary education, which might take until 16 or 17. Completing secondary education is a significant milestone, as it's a prerequisite for higher education or entering the workforce. So that's probably one milestone.

Then there's the age of majority. In most countries, 18 is the age when someone becomes an adult legally. In Azerbaijan, the legal age of majority is 18, which means at that age, they can make their own decisions, sign contracts, etc. That's another milestone.

Marriage is another factor. In some cultures, marriage is a key point when children leave home. In Azerbaijan, the legal marriage age is 18 for both men and women, though early marriages might still occur in some regions. So getting married could be a milestone for independence.

Employment is also important. Once a child is employed, they might start living independently, especially if they're working in a city away from home. The age when they start working might be a milestone, but I'm not sure if there's a specific age or if it's more about completing education first.

Another aspect could be moving out of the family home. In some cultures, this happens after marriage or after completing education. In Azerbaijan, perhaps moving out after finishing school or when starting a job is considered a milestone.

Also, military service might be a factor. In some countries, conscription is mandatory, and that could be a turning point. However, I think Azerbaijan has a conscription system, but I'm not certain if it's a common milestone for independence. Maybe not, since it's a temporary situation.

Legal emancipation is another possibility. If a minor is emancipated by a court, that's a formal step towards independence, but I don't know how common that is in Azerbaijan.

I should also consider cultural norms. In some societies, even if someone is",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What is the most common form of private education in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most common form of private education in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about education systems in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has a mix of public and private schools. Private education might include things like international schools, religious schools, or specialized institutions.

I remember that in many countries, private schools can be either religious or secular. Azerbaijan has a significant Muslim population, so maybe there are a lot of religious private schools. However, I also know that there are international schools catering to expatriates or students aiming for foreign universities. But are those the most common?

Wait, the question is about the ""most common"" form. So even if international schools exist, maybe they are not the majority. Another angle: after the Soviet era, Azerbaijan might have a lot of private madrasas or Islamic schools. But I'm not sure if those are considered the most common.

Alternatively, maybe private tutoring or home schooling? But that might not be as structured as formal private schools. I think the most common private education form in Azerbaijan is private schools that follow the national curriculum but are privately run. However, I should check if there's a specific term for them. 

Wait, I've read before that in Azerbaijan, private schools are called ""məktəb"" in Azerbaijani, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, there are ""private secondary schools"" or ""independent schools."" However, the most common might be international schools, especially in cities like Baku. But I'm not certain. Another thought: after the collapse of the USSR, many private schools were established, but they might be more focused on religious education. 

Alternatively, maybe the most common is private higher education institutions. But the question specifies ""private education,"" which could include all levels. I think the answer is private secondary schools, but I need to be precise. Let me try to recall or think of sources. 

I think the correct answer is that the most common form is private schools, specifically those following the national curriculum but operated by private entities. However, in some contexts, private religious schools might be more prevalent. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe it's private tutoring centers, but that's more supplementary. 

Wait, looking up in my memory, Azerbaijan has a significant number of private schools, especially in urban areas. They might be called ""private secondary schools"" or ""independent schools."" But the exact term might be ""məktəb"" in Azerbaijani. However",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""What is a common snack for preschool kids in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what a common snack for preschool kids in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, so their food might have influences from both Middle Eastern and Central Asian cuisines.

I know that traditional Azerbaijani dishes often include things like plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed grape leaves or vegetables), and various types of bread. But those are more main meals. For snacks, especially for kids, it might be something simpler, maybe sweet or salty.

I remember that in many countries, sweets are popular snacks for children. In Azerbaijan, there's a traditional sweet called ""shekerbura,"" which is a type of candy made from sugar and nuts. Another possibility is ""halva,"" which is a dense, sweet confection made from sesame seeds, sugar, and oil. Both of these are common in the region and might be given as snacks.

Alternatively, there's ""paklava,"" which is a layered pastry filled with nuts and syrup. But that's more of a dessert, maybe not a typical everyday snack for preschoolers. Also, considering preschoolers might have smaller portions, maybe something like ""karakoch"" (a type of sweet roll) or ""gözleme"" (a stuffed flatbread), but I'm not sure if those are common for kids.

Another angle: in some cultures, fruits are common snacks. Maybe dried fruits like apricots or prunes, which are popular in the Caucasus. But the question specifies a common snack, so maybe a more traditional item.

I think ""shekerbura"" is more likely because it's a traditional candy that's small and sweet, suitable for kids. Alternatively, ""halva"" is also a possibility. But I need to verify which one is more commonly associated with preschool snacks. Maybe checking if there are any sources or common knowledge about Azerbaijani children's snacks.

Wait, I also recall that in some regions, ""shishbarma"" is a dish, but that's more of a meat dish. Not a snack for kids. Maybe ""chips"" or ""crackers"" are also common, but those are more Western influences. However, traditional snacks would be more likely.

Considering the options, ""shekerbura"" seems more traditional and suitable as a snack. Alternatively, ""halva"" is also a possibility. But I need to pick one.",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What animals are commonly used for agriculture in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what animals are commonly used for agriculture in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about agriculture in that region. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus, known for its diverse geography, including mountains, plains, and coastal areas. Their agriculture would likely include both livestock and crops.

First, I should think about common livestock in the region. In many Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, cattle, sheep, and goats are prevalent. These animals are used for meat, milk, and wool. Also, horses might be used, especially in rural areas for transportation or farming tasks. Poultry like chickens and ducks are common in many places for eggs and meat.

Then there's the aspect of draught animals. In areas where machinery isn't widely used, animals like oxen or donkeys might be used for plowing fields. However, I'm not sure if oxen are specifically common in Azerbaijan. Maybe horses are used more for that purpose.

Another angle is looking at specific breeds native to the region. For example, the Azerbaijani sheep breed might be common. Also, there's the Karabakh horse, which is a local breed. But I need to verify if these are actually used in agriculture or more for other purposes like racing or cultural events.

Additionally, considering the climate, Azerbaijan has a variety of climates from subtropical to continental. This might influence the types of animals kept. For example, in the southern regions with a drier climate, camels might be used, but I think camels are more common in desert regions like Turkmenistan or Kazakhstan. Not sure about Azerbaijan.

I should also think about dairy and meat production. Cows for milk, sheep and goats for meat and milk, chickens for eggs. Pigs might be less common due to religious reasons, but I'm not certain. In some Muslim-majority countries, pork isn't consumed, so pigs might not be a common agricultural animal there.

Looking up some sources in my mind, I remember that Azerbaijan's agriculture includes livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and poultry. Maybe also donkeys and mules for labor. But I need to be careful not to include animals that aren't commonly used there. For example, alpacas or llamas are not native to the region.

So compiling this, the answer would likely include cattle, sheep, goats, horses, chickens, and possibly donkeys. I need to make sure these are the most common ones. Also, check if",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""When is the first day that people celebrate after a child is born in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the first day people celebrate after a child is born in Azerbaijan. Let me think. I know that in many cultures, there are specific traditions or holidays related to a newborn. For example, in some countries, there's a celebration on the 40th day, like in some Christian traditions. But I need to focus on Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan has a mix of traditions, including Islamic and local customs. I remember that in some Islamic cultures, there's a celebration called ""Aqiqah"" which is held on the 7th day after the birth. But I'm not sure if that's specifically in Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe there's a different tradition there. Wait, I think in Azerbaijan, they might have a celebration on the 40th day, similar to the Christian ""Forty Days"" tradition, but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe it's the 1st day, but that seems too soon. Also, considering the name of the celebration, perhaps ""Nowruz"" is involved, but Nowruz is a New Year celebration, not related to a child's birth. Another angle: in some countries, they have a ""name day"" or a specific ceremony on the first day. However, I need to check specific sources.

Wait, I think in Azerbaijan, the first celebration after a child's birth is on the 7th day, called ""Seyf"" or ""Seyfet"". But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the 40th day. Let me try to recall. Some sources mention that in Azerbaijani culture, the 40th day is significant, similar to the Christian tradition, where the family gathers for a celebration. But others mention the 7th day as the Aqiqah. However, Aqiqah is more common in Islamic countries, and in Azerbaijan, which is a Muslim country, they might follow that. But I need to be precise.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific name for the first day. Wait, the first day is just the day of birth, but the celebration might be on the 7th or 40th. Let me check. If I can't find exact info, maybe the answer is the 7th day. But I need to be sure. Another thought: in some regions, the 40th day is when the baby is presented to the community, but in others,",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What symbolic food do people from Azerbaijan eat on (Lunar) New Year?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the symbolic food eaten by people in Azerbaijan during the Lunar New Year. First, I need to confirm whether Azerbaijan celebrates the Lunar New Year. I know that Azerbaijan primarily follows the solar calendar for their New Year, which is on January 1st. However, there might be some cultural influences or minority groups that observe the Lunar New Year.

Wait, Azerbaijan is a predominantly Muslim country, and the Lunar New Year is a Chinese tradition. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. However, the user specifically mentioned (Lunar) New Year, so perhaps they are referring to a different context or a specific community within Azerbaijan. Alternatively, maybe the user is conflating different New Year celebrations.

I should check if there's any traditional food associated with Lunar New Year in Azerbaijan. But given that the Lunar New Year isn't a traditional holiday there, the answer might be that they don't have a specific symbolic food for Lunar New Year. However, the user might be thinking of another festival or a general New Year celebration. Alternatively, maybe they are referring to the Nowruz festival, which is a spring festival celebrated in many countries, including Azerbaijan. Nowruz is based on the solar calendar and involves specific foods like sumalak, a wheat germ porridge.

But the question specifically mentions Lunar New Year, not Nowruz. So there's a possibility that the user made a mistake in the name of the festival. However, since the question is about Lunar New Year, I need to address that. If there's no traditional food for Lunar New Year in Azerbaijan, the answer would be that they don't have a specific symbolic food for that occasion. However, if the user is referring to another celebration, like Nowruz, then the answer would be different. But the user explicitly said Lunar New Year, so I should stick to that. Therefore, the answer might be that there isn't a symbolic food for Lunar New Year in Azerbaijan, but I need to confirm this.

Alternatively, maybe there are some communities in Azerbaijan that observe Lunar New Year, such as the Chinese minority. In that case, they might eat traditional Chinese New Year foods like dumplings or fish. However, I'm not sure if that's the case. The Chinese community in Azerbaijan is small, so the traditional foods might not be widely known or practiced on a national level. Therefore, the answer could be that there's no specific symbolic food for Lunar New Year in Azerbaijan, as it's not a traditional celebration there. But I need to make",1,,,0,0

{""question"":""What do people from Azerbaijan eat in Ramadan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking what people in Azerbaijan eat during Ramadan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine and Ramadan traditions.

First, I know that during Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, so the main meals would be iftar (the evening meal to break the fast) and suhoor (the pre-dawn meal). I need to think about typical dishes in Azerbaijan that are consumed during these times.

Azerbaijani cuisine is influenced by Persian, Turkish, and Central Asian flavors. Common dishes include plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed grape leaves or vegetables), and various types of kebabs. Also, there's a lot of use of herbs and spices.

For iftar, people might eat light snacks first, like dates or fruits, as the Prophet Muhammad started his fast with dates. Then, the main meal would include dishes like plov, which is a staple. Dolma is also popular. Another dish could be ""kufte,"" which are meatballs or meatballs in a sauce. ""Shish kebab"" might be part of the meal as well. For suhoor, they might have more substantial foods that keep them full throughout the day, like eggs, bread, cheese, or soups.

I should also consider sweets and desserts. Azerbaijani desserts like ""gurme"" (a type of sweet made with nuts and syrup) or ""baklava"" might be served during iftar. However, the user might be more interested in the main meals rather than desserts, but it's worth mentioning if they are part of the typical meal.

Wait, the user asked specifically for what people eat in Ramadan, so I need to ensure the answer includes both iftar and suhoor items. Also, make sure to list them in a JSON format as per the instructions. Let me verify if there are any other specific dishes unique to Azerbaijan during Ramadan. Maybe ""pilaf"" is another term for plov, so I should use the correct term. Also, ""shashlik"" is a type of kebab, so that's another possibility.

I need to compile a list that's accurate and representative of Azerbaijani cuisine during Ramadan. Let me check if I'm missing any key dishes. Maybe ""manti"" (dumplings) are also eaten, but I'm not sure if they're specific to Ramadan. It's safer to stick to the most common ones. Also,",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What drink is commonly consumed in Azerbaijan when the weather is cold?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking what drink is commonly consumed in Azerbaijan during cold weather. Let me think about this.

First, I know that in many countries, hot beverages are popular when it's cold. For example, tea is common in several places. But I need to focus on Azerbaijan specifically. 

Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their culture has influences from both Middle Eastern and Central Asian traditions. I remember that tea is a significant part of their culture. They might have a specific type of tea or a traditional drink that's especially popular in winter.

Wait, there's a drink called ""chai"" which is tea, but maybe they have a variation. Alternatively, there's a drink called ""shirin"" which is a sweetened tea, but I'm not sure if that's specific to cold weather. Another possibility is ""mammoth"" or ""mammut"" which is a type of fermented milk drink, but I think that's more of a traditional drink rather than specifically for cold weather.

Wait, maybe it's ""qaymaq"" which is a type of cream or butter, but that's more of a food. Alternatively, ""pilaf"" is a dish, not a drink. Let me think again.

I recall that in Azerbaijan, they have a tradition of drinking tea, especially black tea. They might prepare it strong and add sugar. During cold weather, people might prefer hot tea. Another possibility is ""sherbety"" which is a type of syrup or drink, but not sure.

Alternatively, there's a drink called ""kumis"" which is fermented mare's milk, but that's more traditional and not sure about its popularity in cold weather. Maybe ""ayran"" which is a yogurt drink, but that's more of a refreshing drink, maybe not specifically for cold weather.

Wait, I think the answer is tea. Because in many parts of the Caucasus and Central Asia, tea is a staple, especially in colder months. So maybe the answer is tea. But I need to confirm if there's a specific type. Alternatively, maybe ""chay"" is the term used there. But the question is asking for the drink, so the answer would be tea. Let me check if there's another drink. 

Alternatively, ""pomegranate juice"" is popular in Azerbaijan, but that's not necessarily for cold weather. Maybe ""sharbat"" which is a syrup-based drink, but again, not sure.",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What do people eat on their birthday in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what people eat on their birthday in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling any information I have about Azerbaijani cuisine. I know that Azerbaijani food is influenced by Persian, Turkish, and Central Asian cuisines. Common dishes include things like plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), dolma (stuffed vegetables or grape leaves), and various types of kebabs.

Now, for birthdays specifically, I'm not entirely sure, but I can make some educated guesses. In many cultures, celebratory meals often include traditional dishes that are considered special or festive. Plov might be a staple because it's a popular dish for gatherings. Also, there's a dish called ""pilaf"" which is similar to plov. Maybe they serve it on birthdays.

Another thing to consider is the use of sweets and desserts. In many countries, birthday cakes are common, but in Azerbaijan, they might have their own traditional desserts. Sütlaç, which is a rice pudding, is a traditional dessert there. Maybe that's served on birthdays.

Cheese is also a part of Azerbaijani cuisine, and there's a type called ""qara qoz"" (black cheese) which is a salty cheese. Perhaps it's included in birthday meals. Also, various types of bread like lavash or馕 (nan) might be served.

I should also think about any specific birthday customs. For example, in some cultures, they might have a special dish that's only eaten on birthdays. But I'm not sure if Azerbaijan has that. Alternatively, they might just have a feast with their usual favorite dishes.

Wait, I remember reading that in Azerbaijan, people might eat ""göyeböyrü"" (a type of pancake) or ""sığır çorbası"" (beef soup) on birthdays. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they have a special cake called ""qazma"" which is a layered cake. However, I need to verify if these are actually traditional birthday foods.

Another angle: looking at the structure of the answer. The user wants a list in JSON format, so I need to provide a list of dishes. Based on the information I have, the most likely candidates are plov (rice with meat and vegetables), sütlaç (rice pudding), qara qoz (black cheese), and maybe some types of bread.

{""question"":""Which subject’s academy/private educational institute do middle or high students most frequently attend in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Azerbaijan attend most frequently. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about education in Azerbaijan. The country has a system that includes public and private schools. Private institutes might focus on specific subjects where students seek extra help. Common subjects that students might need additional tutoring for could be math, science, languages, or maybe even arts.

I remember that in many countries, math and science are common areas where students take private lessons. But I should check if there's any specific data about Azerbaijan. Maybe there are private institutes that specialize in certain subjects. For example, I've heard of ""Pirali"" or ""Najaf"" academies, but I'm not sure about their focus.

Wait, in Azerbaijan, the language of instruction is often Azerbaijani, but Russian is also widely used. So maybe there are institutes focused on Russian language? Or perhaps English? However, the question is about the subject that's most frequently attended. 

Another angle: the education system in Azerbaijan might have certain subjects that are more challenging, leading students to seek private tutoring. In many cases, math, physics, and chemistry are common subjects for private institutes because they are considered harder and require more practice. Also, preparing for entrance exams to higher education might drive students to take extra classes in these areas.

Alternatively, maybe there are more institutes focused on humanities like literature or history. But I think STEM subjects are more likely to have private academies. However, I need to be specific. Are there any well-known academies in Azerbaijan that are particularly popular? 

I think the most common ones are math and physics. For example, there are institutes that prepare students for the ""Bakı"" or ""Ganja"" city exams, which might focus on these subjects. Also, considering the national exams (like the ""YGS"" or ""YGS"") which are important for university admissions, students might take private classes in math and science.

So, putting this together, the answer is likely math and physics. But the user wants a single answer as a list. Wait, the question says ""subject’s academy/private educational institute""—so maybe the subject is the main focus. Therefore, the most frequent subjects would be math and physics. But I need to confirm if there's a primary one. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""mathematics and physics"" as the most common. However, I should check",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall what I know about Azerbaijan's education system. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and their education system is influenced by both Soviet traditions and their own cultural values. In many countries, subjects like mathematics, science, and languages are emphasized, but there might be specific factors in Azerbaijan.

I remember that Azerbaijan has a strong focus on the Russian language, but since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, they've been promoting the Azerbaijani language more. However, Russian is still widely taught because of historical ties and the need for communication with neighboring countries. Also, the education system might prioritize subjects that are important for higher education and university entrance exams.

Another angle is that in many countries, the most important subject is often the one that's central to the national identity or required for academic advancement. In Azerbaijan, the national language is Azerbaijani, but the education system might require students to study Russian as well. However, the question is about the most important subject, which could be different. 

Wait, there's also the subject of history and literature, which are important for national identity. But I'm not sure if that's considered the most important. Alternatively, subjects like mathematics or science might be emphasized for their role in STEM fields and higher education.

But I need to verify if there's a specific subject that's highlighted in Azerbaijan's curriculum. I recall that Azerbaijani is the primary language of instruction, but Russian is also a mandatory subject. However, the most important subject might be the one that's required for the entrance exams to universities. In many countries, subjects like math, physics, and literature are key.

Alternatively, maybe the most important subject is the one that's most tested in the national exams. In Azerbaijan, the Unified State Examination (USE) includes subjects like Azerbaijani language, mathematics, and Russian. However, the importance might vary based on the field of study. For example, students aiming for humanities might focus more on Azerbaijani literature, while those in engineering might prioritize math and physics.

But the question is about the most important subject overall. Given that Azerbaijani is the national language, and the country has been emphasizing its use in education, it's possible that Azerbaijani language and literature are considered the most important. However, I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that the subject",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What food items do people typically pair with hard liquor in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what food items people in Azerbaijan typically pair with hard liquor. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine and drinking habits.

Azerbaijan is a country with a rich culinary tradition influenced by Persian, Turkish, and Caucasus cuisines. They have a variety of dishes, including grilled meats, pilafs, and various mezes. Now, when it comes to pairing food with hard liquor, which in this context might refer to spirits like vodka, brandy, or other strong alcoholic drinks.

In many cultures, hard liquor is paired with salty or savory snacks to balance the strong flavors. For example, in Russia, people might have pickles or salted fish with vodka. Considering Azerbaijani cuisine, they have dishes like kebabs, which are grilled meats. Maybe they pair vodka with something similar. Also, there's a dish called ""dolma,"" which is stuffed grape leaves, but that's more of a main dish. 

Another thought: Azerbaijani people might have traditional snacks like ""saryogly"" (a type of flatbread), or maybe ""mchetti"" (a kind of cheese). Also, there's ""shashlik,"" which is similar to kebabs. But I'm not sure if these are specifically paired with hard liquor. 

Wait, I should check if there are specific appetizers or snacks commonly served with spirits. Maybe ""meze"" items, which are small dishes. In the Caucasus region, meze often includes things like olives, cheese, pickled vegetables, and various meats. Since Azerbaijan is part of the Caucasus, this could be relevant. 

Also, considering the local production of brandy, which is a common hard liquor there, they might pair it with something that complements the fruitiness of the brandy. Maybe something sweet or savory. 

I think the answer would include items like grilled meats (like kebabs), cheese, bread, and pickled vegetables. But I need to be precise. Maybe ""dolma"" is more of a main dish, but perhaps ""ash"" (soup) isn't typically paired with hard liquor. 

Wait, another angle: in some cultures, they eat salty snacks with alcohol to counteract the burning sensation. So maybe salted nuts, cheese, or cured meats.

{""question"":""Where do the dependent elderly usually live in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out where dependent elderly people usually live in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's social structure and elderly care.

First, in many countries, elderly care can be provided in various settings like family homes, nursing homes, or community centers. But I should check if Azerbaijan has specific institutions for this. I remember that in some countries, especially those with strong family traditions, elderly might live with their children. However, urbanization and economic factors might influence this.

Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region. I think there might be state-run homes or facilities for the elderly. Also, maybe there are community-based care options. But I'm not sure about the specifics. Let me think if there are any terms in Azerbaijani that refer to such places. Maybe ""hazır"" or something similar, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, they might use Russian terms like ""дом престарелых"" (dom prestarelykh), which translates to ""old people's home.""

Another angle: looking at the country's demographics. Azerbaijan has a population that's aging, so the government might have established institutions. However, in some cases, especially in rural areas, families might take care of their elderly. But the question is about where they ""usually"" live. If the majority live with their families, that would be the answer. But I need to verify this.

I should also consider if there are any reports or studies on elderly care in Azerbaijan. From what I recall, in some former Soviet countries, there were state-run homes, but family care is still common. However, with economic challenges, some elderly might end up in institutions if family support isn't feasible.

Wait, but the question is about ""dependent elderly,"" which implies those who need more care. So they might be in specialized facilities. However, if the answer is that they live with their families, that's possible. But I need to be accurate.

Alternatively, maybe a mix of both. However, the answer needs to be a single list. If I'm uncertain, perhaps the safest answer is that they live with their families, as in many cultures in the region. But I should check if there are specific institutions. Maybe in cities, there are more homes, while in rural areas, family care is more common. However, the question asks for the usual place, so maybe the primary answer is family homes.

{""question"":""What is the most popular sports among children in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular sports among children in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has a strong tradition in certain sports, like wrestling and chess. They've had successful athletes in those areas. But I'm not sure how popular these are specifically among children.

Wrestling, especially freestyle wrestling, is a big deal there. Maybe that's a candidate. Then there's chess; I remember hearing about young chess prodigies from Azerbaijan. Also, maybe football (soccer) is popular since it's a global sport and widely played. But I need to check if that's the case in Azerbaijan.

I should also consider other sports. Maybe martial arts like judo or sambo? Or team sports like basketball or volleyball? However, I think the government might promote certain sports more. For example, Azerbaijan has invested in sports infrastructure and training programs. They might emphasize sports where they have competitive success.

Looking up some information, I see that wrestling is indeed a traditional sport in Azerbaijan, with a long history. Chess is also very popular, with the country producing top players. Football is definitely a major sport, with a large following. But which one is most popular among children specifically?

Another angle: school programs. If schools promote certain sports, that could influence children's participation. Also, media coverage might play a role. If there are popular athletes in a sport, kids might be inspired to take it up.

I think the answer might be wrestling and football, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, chess could be a strong contender. Maybe the top three are wrestling, football, and chess. However, the question asks for the most popular, so perhaps one sport. But the user might expect multiple. Wait, the user's example shows a list, so maybe multiple answers.

But I need to confirm which ones are actually popular among children. From what I recall, wrestling is definitely a traditional sport with a lot of youth participation. Football is also very popular. Chess is another one. So maybe the answer includes wrestling, football, and chess. But I should check if there's any data or sources confirming this. Since I can't access current data, I'll rely on general knowledge. So, the most popular sports among children in Azerbaijan are wrestling, football (soccer),",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which coffee shop brand is the most popular in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about coffee culture there. Azerbaijan has a growing café scene, especially in cities like Baku. I remember that there are both international chains and local brands.

First, I should consider major international coffee chains that might have a presence in Azerbaijan. Starbucks is pretty widespread globally, so they might be there. Then there's Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, which I think is also present in some countries. Maybe Costa Coffee or others? But I'm not sure if they have locations in Azerbaijan.

Then there are local brands. I've heard of a place called ""Café 77"" in Baku, which is a popular spot. Also, ""Nar"" is a chain that has cafés and might serve coffee. Another one could be ""Kahve"" or ""Café de l'Escargot,"" but I'm not certain about their popularity.

I should check if there are any surveys or rankings about coffee shop popularity in Azerbaijan. However, since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I remember, Starbucks has a significant presence in Baku, with multiple outlets. But local cafes might be more popular among locals due to their ambiance and community feel.

Wait, but the question is about the most popular brand. If Starbucks is available, they might be the top choice. However, I'm not entirely sure if they are the most popular or if a local chain like Café 77 or Nar is more favored. Another angle: sometimes in countries, international chains are common, but local brands might have a stronger following. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a brand that's a mix, like a local chain that's expanded. I think ""Nar"" is a restaurant chain that also has cafés, so they might be popular. But I'm not certain. 

Another thought: in some countries, coffee culture is more about traditional drinks, but Azerbaijan has a growing interest in Western-style coffee. So Starbucks or similar chains might be leading. However, I need to be careful not to assume. If I can't confirm, maybe the safest answer is Starbucks, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a local brand that's more prominent. 

Wait, I've heard that ""Café 77"" is one of the most popular in Baku. But is that a chain",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What type of clubs are most popular among university students in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what types of clubs are most popular among university students in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's culture and education system.

First, Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, with a mix of Eastern and Western influences. The education system includes both public and private universities, and students often engage in various extracurricular activities. However, specific information on club popularity might be limited. 

I know that in many countries, cultural, academic, and sports clubs are common. But I should check if there are any unique aspects in Azerbaijan. Maybe language clubs, since Azerbaijani is the official language, but there might be interest in learning other languages like English or Russian. Also, considering the country's history, perhaps historical or cultural clubs related to Azerbaijani traditions.

Another angle: universities might have technical or scientific clubs, especially in engineering or IT fields, which are growing areas. Also, social or volunteer clubs could be popular. However, without specific data, I need to make educated guesses based on common trends.

Wait, I should also consider the influence of the internet and social media. Maybe online clubs or groups focused on technology, gaming, or creative arts. But again, this is speculative.

Since the user wants a list in JSON format, I need to provide the most likely answer based on general knowledge. Common popular clubs in universities worldwide include cultural, sports, academic, and language clubs. So applying that to Azerbaijan, it's safe to assume similar categories. However, maybe there's a stronger emphasis on cultural clubs related to Azerbaijani heritage, given the national pride. Also, considering the youth demographic, maybe music or art clubs.

But I need to be cautious not to assume too much. The safest answer would be to list general categories that are typically popular, such as cultural, sports, academic, and language clubs, but tailored to the local context. However, since I don't have specific data, the answer might be a standard list. Alternatively, perhaps the most popular are cultural and language clubs, given the importance of preserving national identity and learning foreign languages for career opportunities.

So, compiling this, the answer might be: [""cultural clubs"", ""language clubs"", ""sports clubs"", ""academic and scientific clubs"", ""social and volunteer clubs""]. But I need to ensure that these are the most likely. Another thought: in some countries, technical or IT clubs are very popular, especially among engineering students. So maybe include that.

{""question"":""What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, the user is asking what's typically found in the back gardens of houses in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this. I know that in many countries, backyards can vary a lot based on culture, climate, and urban vs. rural areas. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, so maybe their gardens have some specific elements.

First, the climate. Azerbaijan has a diverse climate, but generally, it's temperate. Winters can be cold, and summers are warm. So plants that can handle that might be common. Maybe fruit trees? Like apricots, cherries, or grapes. I've heard that in some parts of the Caucasus, people grow fruit trees in their yards. Also, maybe vegetables, since home gardening is common in many cultures for fresh produce.

Another thought: traditional architecture in Azerbaijan might include elements like courtyards or small gardens. Maybe there are ornamental plants or flowers. Also, considering the cultural aspect, maybe some herbs or plants used in local cuisine, like mint or basil.

But the question specifies ""back garden,"" so maybe more practical items. Fences? Maybe, but that's more of a structure. Pergolas or shaded areas for sitting? Not sure. Also, maybe animals, like chickens or rabbits, but that might be less common in urban areas. 

Wait, the user wants one single answer as a list. So I need to think of the most typical items. Let me check some sources or common knowledge. I remember that in many Middle Eastern and Caucasian countries, backyards often have fruit trees, vegetable patches, and maybe some ornamental plants. Also, given the region's history, maybe some traditional elements like fountains or decorative features. However, the answer should be specific to Azerbaijan.

Another angle: Azerbaijan's cuisine uses a lot of herbs and vegetables. So it's possible that back gardens have herbs like dill, parsley, coriander, and vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers. Also, maybe grapes for wine or raisins, since Azerbaijan is known for its wine production. 

But I need to make sure these are typical in back gardens, not just farms. So maybe a mix of fruit trees, vegetable gardens, and some ornamental plants. Also, considering the climate, maybe plants that are drought-resistant or suited to the local soil. 

I think the answer would be a list including fruit trees, vegetable gardens, herbs, and maybe ornamental plants. Let me verify if there's anything more specific",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""What are popular snacks in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about popular snacks in Azerbaijan. I need to come up with a list of common Azerbaijani snacks. First, I should recall what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. I remember that they have a lot of dishes influenced by Persian and Turkish cuisines. 

Paklava comes to mind—it's a sweet pastry made with layers of phyllo and nuts, often soaked in syrup. That's definitely popular. Then there's dolma, which are stuffed grape leaves or vegetables. Wait, but sometimes dolma can refer to stuffed vegetables in other countries too. Maybe in Azerbaijan, they have a specific version.

Another thing is taramsak, which are dried and salted fish, often eaten with bread. That's a traditional snack. Also, there's a dish called ""sahur"" which is a type of flatbread, but I'm not sure if it's a snack or a main dish. Maybe not. 

Then there's ""pilaf"" but that's more of a main dish. Wait, maybe ""gazma"" which is a type of dumpling. Or maybe ""shish kebab,"" but that's more of a grilled meat dish. 

Oh, there's also ""qurut"" which is dried yogurt balls. That's a snack. And ""milk bread"" called ""milk qoz"" or something similar? Not sure. 

Wait, I think ""kufte"" is a type of meatball, but again, maybe more of a main dish. 

Let me think again. Other snacks might include ""shirin"" which are sweet pastries, or ""sugud"" which is a type of noodle dish. But maybe those are more regional. 

I should verify some of these. Paklava is definitely a staple. Taramsak is a traditional snack. Dolma is common. Then there's ""ghovlou"" which is a type of cheese, but not sure if it's a snack. 

Wait, ""sahur"" is actually a type of flatbread often eaten with tea, so maybe that's a snack. Also, ""kutahya"" is a type of pastry, but I'm not sure. 

I think the main ones are paklava, dolma, taramsak, and maybe ""qurut"" (dried yogurt). Are there others? Maybe ""manti"" which are dumplings",1,,,1,0.5

{""question"":""Which professional sport is the highest paying in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which professional sport is the highest paying in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has a strong presence in sports like weightlifting, wrestling, and maybe boxing. They've had some successful athletes in those areas.

But the question is about which sport is the highest paying. That might not directly correlate with the number of medals or the country's traditional strengths. Maybe it's more about the revenue generated from the sport, such as through sponsorships, media rights, or the popularity of the sport domestically.

I remember that football (soccer) is a popular sport worldwide and often has high revenues, especially with leagues like the Premier League in England. But does Azerbaijan have a professional football league? Yes, the Azerbaijan Premier League. However, I'm not sure if it's the highest paying in the country. Maybe other sports like boxing or wrestling have higher individual earnings for athletes?

Another angle: professional sports in Azerbaijan might not be as developed as in larger countries. For example, maybe the top athletes in wrestling or weightlifting earn more than footballers because those sports are more prominent in the country's Olympic success. But I'm not certain about the actual salaries.

Alternatively, maybe there are other sports like basketball or volleyball, but I don't think they have the same level of professional structure in Azerbaijan. Also, considering the presence of professional teams and sponsorships, football might have more commercial opportunities even if the league isn't as high-profile as others.

Wait, but the question is about the sport itself, not the league. So if a sport has more international recognition, maybe its athletes can earn more through endorsements and competitions. For example, if Azerbaijani boxers are well-known, they might earn more than footballers. However, I need to verify this.

I might need to check some sources, but since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I recall, Azerbaijan has produced notable athletes in weightlifting and wrestling, but I'm not sure about their earnings compared to other sports. However, considering the global reach of football, even if the domestic league isn't the top, the athletes might have more opportunities to play abroad, leading to higher incomes.

Alternatively, maybe the highest paying sport is not a team sport but an individual one where top athletes can earn substantial prize money and sponsorships. For example, boxing matches can have high payouts, but again, I'm not certain about Azerbaijan's",1,,,1,1.0

{""question"":""Who is the most popular soccer coach in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular soccer coach in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani football. Azerbaijan has a national team, and there are several clubs in the country, like Qarabag FK, which is one of the most successful. 

First, I should think about the national team coach. As of recent years, the head coach of the Azerbaijani national team has been Safar Abiyev. He took charge in 2021, and there was some controversy around his appointment, but he's been in the role for a while. However, popularity might not just be about the national team; club coaches could also be very popular, especially if their teams are performing well.

Qarabag FK's coach is another person to consider. Recently, their head coach was Erol Soytürk, but I think he left around 2023. They might have a new coach now. If the current coach has led Qarabag to success, like winning the league or cups, they might be more popular among fans.

Also, there's the possibility of other coaches who have made significant impacts in the past. For example, maybe someone who has won multiple titles or has a strong fan base. But I need to check who is currently active and popular.

I should verify the current national team coach. Let me think—Safar Abiyev was appointed in 2021, and as of 2023, he was still in the position. However, there might have been changes recently. If there's no recent change, he might still be the one. But popularity can be subjective. Maybe fans prefer someone else, but without specific data on popularity polls, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, club coaches might be more popular due to their direct impact on domestic leagues. If Qarabag's current coach is someone like, say, Rovshan Bayramov or another name, that could be the case. Wait, I think Qarabag had a coach named Rovshan Bayramov who was involved in some controversies but also had a strong tenure. However, I need to confirm if he's still coaching there or if someone else has taken over.

Another angle: looking at social media presence or fan engagement. Coaches with large followings might be considered more popular. But without specific data, it's tricky.

{""question"":""Which cities or regions are known for their import and export activities in Azerbaijan?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out which cities or regions in Azerbaijan are known for their import and export activities. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's economy and geography.

Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, with a significant oil and gas industry. Their economy relies heavily on exports of oil and gas. The main port for exports would probably be a coastal city. Baku is the capital and the largest city, so that's likely a major hub. Also, there's the Caspian Sea, so maybe Baku has a port there.

Then there's the region of Nakhchivan, but I think that's more of an autonomous region with less focus on trade. Maybe the Ganja region? Ganja is another major city, but I'm not sure about its role in imports and exports. 

Another thought: the port of Lankaran? Wait, Lankaran is on the Caspian Sea, but I'm not certain if it's a major port. Alternatively, there's the port of Sumgayit, which I remember is an industrial city near Baku. Sumgayit might be involved in processing and exporting oil products.

Also, the region of Shirvan, but I don't think that's a major trade center. Maybe the city of Ganja or others in the central part of the country. However, considering the main export routes, Baku is definitely central. The port of Baku is a key point for exporting oil and other goods. 

Another angle: the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route. There's a project to use the port of Astara, which is near the Caspian Sea, but I'm not sure if that's active yet. However, Astara might be a point for exports, but maybe not as prominent as Baku.

In terms of imports, the capital city Baku would be the main hub where goods are imported and distributed. Also, the region of Tovuz or others might have some industrial activity, but I think Baku and Sumgayit are the primary cities. 

So compiling this, the main cities involved in import and export would be Baku, Sumgayit, and possibly Lankaran. However, I'm not certain about Lankaran's role. Maybe the answer is Baku and Sumgayit. Alternatively, considering the port of Baku and the industrial areas around it, Sumgayit is a key city. 

Wait, I should verify. Sumgayit is",1,,,1,0.3333333333333333

{""question"":""How many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about the education system there. Azerbaijan follows a structure similar to other countries in the region, with primary, middle, and secondary education.

Middle school in Azerbaijan typically covers grades 5 to 9, right? So that's the secondary level. Now, the number of subjects can vary depending on the curriculum. The main subjects would include core ones like mathematics, science, language, literature, history, geography, physical education, and maybe foreign languages. But I need to be precise.

I remember that the Azerbaijani curriculum has certain mandatory subjects. Let me think. There's mathematics, Azerbaijani language and literature, history of Azerbaijan, world history, geography, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, physical education, music, art, and maybe some social studies. Wait, but some of these might be combined or split into different grades.

Also, there might be additional subjects like foreign languages, usually starting with English in middle school. Then there's maybe technical drawing or something similar. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact count. Maybe I should check the official curriculum structure. However, since I can't access external information, I need to rely on existing knowledge.

Another angle: in many countries, middle school has around 12-15 subjects. But I need to be accurate for Azerbaijan. Let me list them out:

1. Azerbaijani language and literature
2. Mathematics
3. History of Azerbaijan
4. World history
5. Geography
6. Physics
7. Chemistry
8. Biology
9. Computer science
10. Physical education
11. Music
12. Art
13. Foreign language (English, Russian, etc.)
14. Social studies or civic education
15. Technical drawing or labor education

Hmm, that's 15. But I might be including some that aren't standard. Or maybe some subjects are combined. For example, maybe history and geography are part of a broader social studies subject. Also, depending on the school, some subjects might be optional. However, the core curriculum would have a set number.

{""question"":""What is the most popular children's song in Azerbaijan that families sing together?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the most popular children's song in Azerbaijan that families sing together. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and music. Azerbaijan has a rich musical tradition, and children's songs are often part of their cultural heritage.

I remember that in many countries, there are traditional lullabies or folk songs that are commonly sung by families. For example, in some regions, songs like ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" have local versions. But I need to find something specific to Azerbaijan.

I should consider if there are any well-known Azerbaijani children's songs that are widely recognized. Maybe searching for ""Azerbaijan children's songs"" or ""popular Azerbaijani nursery rhymes"" would help. However, since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on my existing knowledge.

I recall that ""Yaşlı Adam"" (The Old Man) is a traditional Azerbaijani song, but I'm not sure if it's a children's song. Another possibility is ""Qara Dağ"" (Black Mountain), which is a folk song, but again, not sure about its popularity among children.

Wait, there's a song called ""Mən Çocuqam"" (I am a Child) that might be popular. Or perhaps ""Sən Məni Sevirsin"" (You Will Love Me), but I'm not certain. Another angle: maybe looking at songs used in educational settings or those passed down through generations.

Alternatively, considering that many countries have a version of ""The Alphabet Song"" or similar, but in Azerbaijani. However, that might not be as popular as a traditional song.

I think I need to check if there's a widely recognized song that's often mentioned in Azerbaijani media or cultural references. Maybe ""Əlini Saldım"" (I Held Your Hand) is a lullaby, but again, not sure about its popularity.

Wait, perhaps the answer is ""Yaşlı Adam"" even if I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe there's a song that's part of the national curriculum or commonly used in kindergartens.

Alternatively, considering that in some cases, the most popular children's song might be a folk song that's been adapted for children. Another thought: ""Sən Məni Sevirsin"" is a traditional love song, but maybe it's also sung to children.

Okay, I need to figure out what food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. They have a variety of dishes, including things like plov (pilaf), dolma, kebabs, and various types of soups. Some dishes might be more traditional or have ingredients that older people prefer.

Children often don't like foods that are spicy, sour, or have strong flavors. Maybe something with a lot of garlic or onions? Or perhaps a dish that's more common in older generations but not as popular with kids. Let me think about specific dishes. There's a dish called ""tavuk göğsü,"" which is a milk-based dessert made from chicken breast. Wait, that's a dessert, but I'm not sure if children like it. Alternatively, there's ""shish kebab,"" but that's more of a meat dish, and kids might like it if they enjoy meat.

Another possibility is ""qutlama,"" which is a sweet dumpling filled with nuts and raisins. But again, not sure about the age preference. Maybe something with a lot of herbs or spices that are more palatable to older people. Wait, I remember that in some cultures, fermented foods are more common among the elderly. In Azerbaijan, there's a dish called ""torpaq"" which is a type of fermented wheat or barley. But I'm not certain if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe ""kərə"" (a type of sour soup) or ""qaz"" (a type of fermented milk drink). These might be more traditional and enjoyed by the elderly, but children might find them too sour or strong. Another thought: ""dolma"" is stuffed grape leaves, but that's usually liked by many ages. 

Wait, there's a dish called ""həşha"" which is a type of porridge made from wheat, often with meat. Maybe that's too heavy for children but preferred by the elderly. Or perhaps ""pilaf"" with specific ingredients. Alternatively, ""kəsəb"" which is a type of flatbread, but that's more of a staple.

I think the most likely answer is ""qaz"" (fermented milk drink) or ""torpaq."" But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, ""kərə"" (sour soup) might be a candidate. However, I should verify if",1,,,1,1.0
