Teachers are expected to dress professionally, often in attire that is similar to what they would wear in a business setting. Modesty and simplicity are highly valued in Chinese culture, so teachers tend to avoid revealing or flashy clothing. For women, this often means wearing long-sleeved blouses, skirts or pants that fall below the knee, and closed-toe shoes. For men, it means wearing dress shirts, trousers, and dress shoes. The dress code may vary slightly depending on the region, school type, and subject area, but overall, a professional and modest approach is the norm."

Additionally, the rise of online streaming platforms has made it easier for families to access a wide range of content, further increasing the popularity of TV viewing as a family activity.""
}

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* According to a survey conducted by the China Media Monitoring Center in 2020, 62.5% of Chinese families reported watching television as their primary evening activity.
* Another study published in the Journal of Chinese Sociology found that TV viewing was the most popular leisure activity among Chinese families, with 71.4% of respondents reporting that they watched TV daily.
* The popularity of TV viewing can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the fact that it is a relatively affordable and accessible form of entertainment, and that it provides a sense of social bonding and togetherness for family members.

Overall, while other activities such as playing board games, going out for dinner, or engaging in outdoor activities may also be popular among Chinese families, watching television remains the most widely practiced and preferred weekday evening family activity in China.",4,"You are Dr. Mei-Ling Chen, a 45-year-old professor of sociology at a prestigious university in Beijing.
