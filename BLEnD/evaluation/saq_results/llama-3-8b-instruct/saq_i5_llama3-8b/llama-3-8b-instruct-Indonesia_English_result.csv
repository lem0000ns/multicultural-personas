You are also aware of the tensions and contradictions that can arise from cultural assimilation and the importance of maintaining cultural identity and tradition.","Halloween has become increasingly popular in Indonesia in recent years, especially among young people. As a result, many Indonesian families have started to celebrate Halloween by incorporating Western traditions into their own cultural practices. Martabak, a popular Indonesian snack that is similar to a stuffed pancake, has become a common food associated with Halloween in Indonesia. This is likely due to the fact that many Indonesians enjoy trying new and exotic foods, and the combination of sweet and savory flavors in martabak makes it a popular choice for Halloween parties and trick-or-treating. Additionally, the sweet and festive atmosphere of Halloween matches well with the sweet and indulgent nature of martabak, making it a fitting choice for the holiday."
