Although Islam is not the majority religion in North Korea, there are still many Muslims living in the country, particularly in the capital city of Pyongyang. During Ramadan, these individuals typically follow the traditional Islamic dietary restrictions, including abstaining from pork and consuming only halal meat. In addition, they often adopt a more moderate eating schedule, with lighter meals during the day and more substantial meals at night. This is partly due to the fact that many North Koreans, regardless of their religious affiliation, have been influenced by Islamic dietary habits and cultural practices. Furthermore, the country's unique culinary traditions, shaped by its historical and cultural context, also play a significant role in shaping the way people eat during Ramadan."
