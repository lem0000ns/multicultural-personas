The traditional Christmas meal, known as 'Nochebuena', usually includes a variety of dishes such as seafood stews, roasted meats like turkey or pork, and vegetables like potatoes and cabbage. In Galicia, where I'm from, seafood is a staple, and you might find dishes like 'arroz con mariscos' (seafood rice) or 'empanada gallega' (a savory pastry filled with seafood). The meal is often followed by dessert, and a glass of wine or 'tinto de verano' (a refreshing summer drink made with red wine and lemon soda).
