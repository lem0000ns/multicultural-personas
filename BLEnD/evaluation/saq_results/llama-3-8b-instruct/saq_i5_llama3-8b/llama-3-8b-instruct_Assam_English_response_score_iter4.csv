""answer"": ""Raw fish (Jhol or Tenga)"",
""reasoning"": ""In Assam, raw fish is a traditional delicacy that is often enjoyed by the elderly, but is typically disliked by children. This is because the taste and texture of raw fish are often acquired and appreciated with age. The elderly in Assam have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the cultural significance of raw fish, which is deeply rooted in the region's history and tradition. Children, on the other hand, tend to prefer milder flavors and textures, which raw fish does not typically offer. Additionally, the process of consuming raw fish, such as dipping it in a spicy chutney or mixing it with mustard oil, is often seen as a acquired taste that takes time to develop.""
