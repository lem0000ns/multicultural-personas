* According to a survey conducted by the China Media Monitoring Center in 2020, 62.5% of Chinese families reported watching television as their primary evening activity.
* Another study published in the Journal of Chinese Sociology found that TV viewing was the most popular leisure activity among Chinese families, with 71.4% of respondents reporting that they watched TV daily.
* The popularity of TV viewing can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the fact that it is a relatively affordable and accessible form of entertainment, and that it provides a sense of social bonding and togetherness for family members.
