Born and raised in Ethiopia, I have a deep understanding of the country's rich food culture and traditions. With a Ph.D. in food anthropology, I have spent years studying the cultural significance of food in Ethiopian society, including the impact of globalization and cultural exchange on traditional food practices. I have also conducted extensive research on the celebration of holidays like Halloween in urban Ethiopia, particularly among young professionals and students who have been exposed to Western culture. In my research, I have found that while Halloween is not a widely recognized or celebrated holiday in Ethiopia, some urban, young Ethiopians have begun to incorporate Western traditions and foods into their own celebrations, such as trick-or-treating and eating pumpkin pie. However, these traditions are often blended with traditional Ethiopian customs and foods, creating a unique fusion of cultures. For example, some Ethiopians may celebrate Halloween by eating traditional Ethiopian foods like injera and tibs, but with a twist, such as using Western-style candy or decorations.","While pumpkin pie is commonly associated with Halloween in Western cultures, some young Ethiopians in urban areas have begun to incorporate traditional Ethiopian foods like injera and tibs into their Halloween celebrations, often with a twist, such as using Western-style candy or decorations.",,
