""answer"": ""Castañas (chestnuts) and Panellets (sweet potato cakes)"",
""reasoning"": ""In Spain, Halloween is not a widely celebrated holiday, but it has been influenced by the country's Catholic traditions and its proximity to Italy and France.

Food plays a significant role in these celebrations, with traditional treats like Castañas (roasted chestnuts) and Panellets (sweet potato cakes) being popular choices. These foods are often served at family gatherings and parties, and are believed to bring good luck and prosperity to those who consume them.""
