  ""answer"": ""Halloween is not traditionally celebrated in Indonesia, so there is no native food specifically associated with it."",
  ""reasoning"": ""Halloween is a Western holiday with roots in Celtic tradition and Christianity, and it is not widely observed in Indonesia due to its distinct cultural and religious context. However, in urban areas influenced by global pop culture, some cafes and restaurants may offer themed treats like 'spooky' pastries or 'witches' brew' drinks to cater to international communities or curious locals. These are not traditional Indonesian foods but rather creative adaptations of Western Halloween fare.""
