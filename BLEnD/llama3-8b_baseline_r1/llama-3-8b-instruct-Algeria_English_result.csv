{""question"":""What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Algeria's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","In Algeria's society, children's independence from their parents is a gradual process that is influenced by cultural, religious, and social factors. The key milestones associated with this independence can be broadly categorized into three stages: childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.

During childhood, children are closely tied to their parents and are expected to obey and respect them. As they grow older, they begin to develop their own interests and personalities, and their relationships with their parents become more equal.

In adolescence, children start to assert their independence and experiment with their own identities. They may begin to make their own decisions and take on more responsibilities, such as helping with household chores or contributing to the family income.

In early adulthood, children are considered fully independent and are expected to take on the responsibilities of adulthood, such as finding a job, getting married, and starting a family.
