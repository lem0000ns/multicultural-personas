If we were to apply this logic to Azerbaijan, we might see some similar sweet treats being consumed during Halloween celebrations. Some examples could include:

* Baklava: a sweet pastry made with layers of phyllo dough, nuts, and honey that is popular in Azerbaijan and other parts of the Middle East.
