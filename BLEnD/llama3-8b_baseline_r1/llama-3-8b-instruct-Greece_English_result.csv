1. Early childhood (0-6 years): Children are heavily dependent on their parents for basic needs, and parents play a crucial role in their development.
2. Pre-teen years (7-12 years): Children start to develop their sense of identity and begin to assert their independence, but still rely heavily on their parents for guidance and support.
3. Teenage years (13-18 years): Children enter adolescence, and their desire for independence grows. They start to take on more responsibilities and make their own decisions, but still require parental guidance and supervision.
4. Young adulthood (19-25 years): Children transition into young adulthood, and their independence increases significantly. They may start to live away from home, work, and make their own decisions, but still maintain close relationships with their parents.
5. Adulthood (26+ years): Children have achieved full independence, and their relationships with their parents shift from dependence to mutual support and friendship.
