In many parts of Spain, especially in urban areas, back gardens (or patios) are often small and compact.

* Shade-providing structures like pergolas, gazebos, or awnings
* Outdoor seating areas, such as benches, tables, and chairs
* Water features like small fountains or bird baths
* Decorative elements like pots, planters, and sculptures
* Functional spaces like laundry rooms or storage areas
