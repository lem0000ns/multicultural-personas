Indonesians tend to prefer casual and affordable dining options, which often involve street food or mid-range restaurants. These types of establishments usually have a quick turnaround, with average waiting times ranging from 15 to 30 minutes.

However, if we're considering higher-end restaurants or those that require reservations, the waiting time can increase to around 45-60 minutes.
