{""question"":""What do people from Mexico eat in Eid ul Fitr?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","Eid ul Fitr is a significant Islamic holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide, including those in Mexico. However, it's essential to note that Mexican cuisine is heavily influenced by Spanish, indigenous, and African traditions, which are not necessarily related to Islamic customs. Therefore, it's unlikely that people from Mexico would traditionally celebrate Eid ul Fitr with specific dishes that are unique to the holiday.

That being said, many Mexicans, particularly those who are Muslim or have Muslim heritage, may still observe Eid ul Fitr and celebrate with traditional Mexican dishes. In this case, they might incorporate Muslim-friendly ingredients and flavors into their celebrations. For instance, they could prepare dishes that are halal (permissible under Islamic law) and avoid those that contain pork or other non-halal ingredients.

Here's the answer in JSON format:
