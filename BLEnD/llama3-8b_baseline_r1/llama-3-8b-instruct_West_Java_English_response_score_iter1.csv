The process is often marked by a series of gradual changes that are influenced by cultural, social, and economic factors. Here's a breakdown of the typical milestones:

1. **Early Childhood (0-6 years)**: Children are heavily dependent on their parents for basic needs, care, and socialization. During this stage, parents take on a nurturing role, providing a safe and supportive environment for their child's growth and development.
2. **Late Childhood (7-12 years)**: As children enter late childhood, they begin to take on more responsibilities and start to develop a sense of autonomy. They may start helping with household chores, participating in extracurricular activities, and forming friendships outside the family.
3. **Early Adolescence (13-15 years)**: During early adolescence, children start to assert their independence, testing boundaries and seeking more freedom. They may begin to take on more responsibilities, such as helping with household finances or contributing to family decisions.
4. **Late Adolescence (16-18 years)**: As children enter late adolescence, they typically become more confident in their abilities and start to make decisions independently. They may start to socialize more outside the family, develop romantic relationships, and explore their career interests.
5. **Young Adulthood (19-25 years)**: In young adulthood, individuals are generally considered independent from their parents, having completed their education, secured employment, and established their own households. They may still rely on their parents for financial support, but they are largely self-sufficient and responsible for their own lives.
6. **Adulthood (26+ years)**: By adulthood, individuals are fully independent from their parents, having established their own careers, families, and social networks. They may still maintain close relationships with their parents, but they are no longer dependent on them for daily care and support.
