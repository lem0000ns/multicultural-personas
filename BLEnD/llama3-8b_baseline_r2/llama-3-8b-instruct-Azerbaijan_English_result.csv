Azerbaijan is a country with a strong cultural heritage, and family ties are highly valued.

Additionally, many high school students in Azerbaijan attend Islamic schools, which emphasize the importance of prayer and spiritual growth. Therefore, it's likely that some high school students may choose to pray or attend religious gatherings after dinner.

However, Azerbaijan is also a modern country with a growing urban population, and many high school students may choose to engage in extracurricular activities or spend time with friends after dinner. They may also watch TV, play video games, or engage in online activities.
