4. High school years (16-18): Students become more responsible for their own academic and extracurricular pursuits. They may take on part-time jobs or internships, and begin to develop their own interests and hobbies outside of family influences.
5. College years (19-22): Young adults are expected to become more independent and self-sufficient. They may live away from home, take on full-time jobs, and make their own decisions about finances, relationships, and career choices.

Some popular Halloween treats in South Korea include:

* ""Kkultarae"" (), a Korean-style cotton candy
* ""Bungeo-ppang"" (), a fish-shaped pastry filled with sweet red bean paste
* ""Hotteok"" (), a sweet pancake-like dessert filled with honey, sugar, and cinnamon

After considering these options, I would conclude that ""Kkultarae"" is the most closely associated with Halloween in South Korea.
