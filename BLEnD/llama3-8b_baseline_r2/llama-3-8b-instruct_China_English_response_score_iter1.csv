{""question"":""Which is the most important meal of the day to people from China?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","In Chinese culture, the concept of ""most important meal of the day"" is not as prominent as it is in Western cultures. However, based on traditional Chinese dietary habits and cultural influences, I would argue that breakfast is not typically considered the most important meal of the day.

In fact, in many parts of China, especially in rural areas, it's common for people to skip breakfast or have a light meal in the morning. This is often due to the fact that many people start their day early and may not have time for a substantial meal.

In contrast, the Chinese typically consider dinner (also known as ""wan'an"" or ) as the most important meal of the day. This is because dinner is often a time for family gatherings, socializing, and sharing meals with others. In many Chinese households, dinner is also the largest and most filling meal of the day.
