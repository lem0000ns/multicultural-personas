{""question"":""What can typically be found in the back garden of houses in North Korea?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","Based on research and reports, it's unlikely to find traditional back gardens in the classical sense in North Korea. This is due to the country's urban planning and agricultural practices. Here's a possible explanation:

In North Korea, urban planning prioritizes densely populated neighborhoods with limited green spaces. The concept of individual back gardens or yards is not a common feature in most residential areas. Instead, many homes are built in high-rise apartment buildings or clusters of low-rise buildings with shared courtyards or communal green spaces. These shared areas may include small patches of grass, trees, or vegetable plots, but they are not typically designated as individual back gardens.

Given this context, it's unlikely to find traditional back gardens with flowers, trees, and outdoor furniture in the backyards of houses in North Korea. Here's the answer in JSON format:
