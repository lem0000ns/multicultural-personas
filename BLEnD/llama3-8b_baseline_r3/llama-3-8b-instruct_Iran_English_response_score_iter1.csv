{""question"":""What office software do people typically use in the workplace in Iran?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","Based on my research, I can provide an answer to the question. Here's my thought process:

Iran is a country with a significant number of IT professionals and startups, and it's common for them to use a mix of free and paid office software solutions. Microsoft Office is widely used globally, and it's likely that many offices in Iran also use it. However, considering the economic sanctions imposed on Iran, many organizations may opt for free and open-source alternatives.

Additionally, given the prevalence of Android and iOS devices in the region, cloud-based office software solutions might be popular among Iranian professionals. Microsoft's own cloud-based office suite, Microsoft 365, might be a popular choice, but it's likely that Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and Microsoft's competitors like Zoho Workplace and LibreOffice Online might also be widely used.

Considering these factors, I'm inclined to believe that a combination of Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, and LibreOffice Online might be commonly used in the workplace in Iran.
