However, it's essential to note that Mexico is a predominantly Catholic country, and Eid ul Fitr is not a widely celebrated holiday there. Nevertheless, there might be some Muslim communities in Mexico that observe the holiday.

Given this context, it's unlikely that people from Mexico would have a traditional or common food associated with Eid ul Fitr. However, if we were to assume that some Mexican Muslims might observe the holiday, they might draw inspiration from their own cultural cuisine and adapt it to their Eid celebrations.

In that case, their Eid ul Fitr menu might include a mix of traditional Mexican dishes, such as tacos, enchiladas, and chiles rellenos, alongside some Middle Eastern or South Asian flavors, which are more commonly associated with Eid celebrations in those regions.
