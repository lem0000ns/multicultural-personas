{""question"":""What are the key milestones associated with children's independence from their parents in Algeria's society?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","In Algerian society, the process of children's independence from their parents is a gradual one, influenced by cultural and religious values. Here are the key milestones associated with this process:

The process begins with the child's entry into primary school, which marks the start of their formal education. As they progress through school, they begin to develop greater autonomy and independence, particularly in their daily routines and personal responsibilities.

In their teenage years, children typically start to take on more responsibilities, such as helping with household chores and contributing to family finances. They may also begin to develop their own social networks and interests outside of the family.

As they approach adulthood, children may start to leave the family home and establish their own independent lives, whether through education, employment, or marriage. This can be a significant milestone in their journey towards independence.
