However, since Thanksgiving is not widely celebrated in the UK, there isn't a traditional main dish specifically associated with the holiday in the UK. But, if I had to provide an answer, I would say that a traditional British Sunday roast, typically featuring roasted meat (such as beef, pork, lamb, or chicken) with roasted vegetables and gravy, might be a more accurate representation of a main dish commonly served in the UK.
