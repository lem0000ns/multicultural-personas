The key milestones associated with this process can be categorized into three stages: early childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood.

During the early childhood stage, children typically rely heavily on their parents for basic needs and emotional support. As they grow and develop, they begin to take on more responsibilities and exhibit signs of independence, such as dressing themselves and using the bathroom independently.

In the adolescence stage, children start to assert their independence and seek more autonomy from their parents. They may begin to make their own decisions, set their own goals, and develop their own interests. This stage is also marked by a desire for independence and a need to establish one's identity.

In the young adulthood stage, children have typically achieved a high level of independence and are self-sufficient. They have developed their own skills and abilities, established their own social relationships, and are able to make their own decisions.
