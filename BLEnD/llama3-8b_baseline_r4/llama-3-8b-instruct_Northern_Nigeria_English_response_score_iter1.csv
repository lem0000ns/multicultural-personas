{""question"":""What type of clothing do middle and high school students wear to school in Northern Nigeria?"",""answer"":[""answer here""]}","Based on research and cultural insights, here's my thought process:

In Northern Nigeria, Islamic dress code and cultural influences play a significant role in shaping the type of clothing worn by middle and high school students. In many Islamic schools and communities, students are expected to dress modestly and adhere to traditional attire. For boys, this often means wearing traditional Hausa or Fulani attire, such as:

* Long, flowing robes called ""babanriga"" or ""dashiki""
* Loose-fitting pants or ""sharwaris""
* A head tie or ""kufi"" to cover their hair
* Traditional sandals or ""babanriga"" slippers

For girls, the dress code is often more restrictive, with a focus on modesty and covering the body. They may wear:

* Long, loose-fitting robes or ""hijabs"" that cover their body and hair
* Flowing skirts or ""jilbabs"" that cover their legs and body
* Long-sleeved blouses or ""abaya"" tops that cover their arms and body
* Traditional head coverings or ""hijabs"" to cover their hair

Considering these cultural and religious influences, here is the answer in JSON format:

This can take various forms, such as providing financial support, helping with household chores, or assisting with daily living activities.

However, this integration can also lead to challenges, such as conflicts over living arrangements, financial resources, and decision-making authority. Additionally, the dependent elderly may experience feelings of isolation, loneliness, and loss of autonomy.
