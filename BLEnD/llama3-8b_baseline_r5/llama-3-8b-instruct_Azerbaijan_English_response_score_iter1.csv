Halloween is not a traditional holiday in Azerbaijan, as it is primarily celebrated in Western countries. However, Azerbaijan has a unique tradition called ""Novruz Bayramı"" or ""Novruz Piri"" which is a spring festival that marks the beginning of spring and is celebrated on March 20th or 21st. This festival has some similarities with Halloween, as it involves costumes, decorations, and food.

During Novruz Bayramı, traditional Azerbaijani foods such as ""Piti"" (a type of stew), ""Shurpa"" (a soup made with lamb or beef broth), and ""Qurut"" (dried yogurt) are prepared and shared among family and friends.
