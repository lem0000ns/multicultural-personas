In the UK, the concept of independence from parents can be subjective and vary from child to child. However, I'll provide a general answer based on common trends and milestones.

Typically, children in the UK tend to become more independent as they reach their late teenage years and early twenties.

They may still rely on their parents for emotional support, but they are more likely to make their own decisions and manage their daily lives independently.
