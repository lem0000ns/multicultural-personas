* Financial independence: Children are expected to become financially independent, either through employment or marriage, and start contributing to their own living expenses. This milestone is often marked by the child's ability to pay for their own living expenses, including rent, food, and other necessities.
* Emotional independence: As children become more self-sufficient, they are expected to develop emotional independence, including making their own decisions, setting their own goals, and building their own social networks.
* Marriage and starting a family: In Algeria, marriage is often seen as a key milestone in a child's journey towards independence. Children typically get married in their late 20s or early 30s, and starting a family is seen as a symbol of their independence and maturity.
* Leaving the family's social circle: As children become more independent, they are expected to start building their own social circles, separate from their parents' social network.

During Ramadan, Algerians tend to focus on traditional and comforting dishes that are easy to prepare and share with family and friends. Our cuisine is heavily influenced by Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors, and we love to incorporate fresh vegetables, fruits, and herbs into our meals.

In the evening, after the sun sets, we typically break our fast with a sweet and savory iftar (evening meal). Some popular dishes include:

* Merguez (spicy sausages with onions and tomatoes)
* Brik (deep-fried pastry filled with tuna, capers, and harissa)
* Couscous (semolina flour-based dish often served with vegetables, meat, and sauce)
* Tagine (slow-cooked stew made with meat, dried fruits, and spices)
* Mhajeb (slow-cooked meat and vegetable stew)
* Khubz (flatbread often served with olive oil, zaatar, and cheese)

In the morning, we also enjoy a light and refreshing suhoor (pre-dawn meal) to help us make it through the day's fasting. Common suhoor dishes include:

* Shakshuka (eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce)
* Msemen (thin, folded pancakes filled with meat, onions, and spices)
* Harsha (thick, creamy porridge made with wheat, milk, and honey)
* Tea with milk and sugar

Of course, every Algerian family has their own unique traditions and preferences when it comes to Ramadan cuisine. But overall, our focus is on nourishing our bodies and spirits with delicious, comforting foods that bring us closer to our faith and loved ones.
