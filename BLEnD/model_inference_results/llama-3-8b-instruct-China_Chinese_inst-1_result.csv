This is because, in traditional Chinese culture, children are expected to take care of their elderly parents and provide financial support as they grow older. This filial piety is deeply ingrained in Chinese society and is seen as a moral obligation. As a result, many young adults in China continue to live with their parents and contribute to the household income well into their twenties and even thirties.

However, with the increasing urbanization and modernization of Chinese society, there is a growing trend towards young adults seeking greater independence and autonomy. Many young adults are now choosing to move out of their parents' homes and start their own families, which can lead to a greater sense of independence and self-sufficiency.

In my experience, children are often expected to take on more responsibilities and contribute to the family financially as they get older. However, the exact age at which children become independent from their parents can vary greatly depending on factors such as family background, education, and career choices.

In general, children in China tend to stay with their parents well into their 20s and even 30s. It's not uncommon for young adults to still live with their parents until they get married or establish their own households. In some cases, children may even continue to rely on their parents financially well into their 40s or even 50s.

That being said, there is a growing trend towards independence and self-sufficiency among younger generations in China. With the increasing cost of living and changing social norms, many young adults are seeking to break free from the traditional expectations of filial piety and establish their own independent lives.

In Chinese culture, the 60th birthday is considered a major life milestone, marking a person's transition from adulthood to old age. It is believed that a person who reaches the age of 60 has lived through a complete cycle of the 12-year Chinese zodiac cycle and has accumulated a wealth of life experience.

The celebration of a 60th birthday is often accompanied by grand ceremonies, family gatherings, and traditional customs such as burning incense, offering sacrifices to ancestors, and giving red envelopes filled with money. The birthday person is also often showered with gifts, such as traditional Chinese clothing, jewelry, and other luxurious items.

In China, the government has implemented strict regulations on religious education in schools. According to the Chinese Constitution, citizens have the freedom to believe in or not believe in a religion, but the government also has the authority to regulate religious activities.

In practice, this means that religious education is not explicitly taught in public schools, and students are not forced to follow a particular religion. However, students are required to study the basics of Chinese history, politics, and philosophy, which often includes the teachings of Confucius and the principles of socialism.

The government has also promoted the development of traditional Chinese culture and values, such as filial piety and respect for elders, which are often linked to Confucianism. However, this is not necessarily the same as teaching religion in a traditional sense.

In China, the highest paying professional sport is undoubtedly basketball, specifically the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) league. The CBA has been a major player in China's sports scene for decades, and its teams and players have become household names.

The CBA's popularity can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the country's love for basketball, the league's competitive nature, and the presence of top-level international talent. The league's top teams, such as the Beijing Ducks and the Guangdong Southern Tigers, are able to attract large crowds and generate significant revenue from ticket sales, merchandise, and sponsorships.

{'question':'At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in China? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)','answer':[]}","As a Shanghai native, I believe that the concept of independence from parents is not as straightforward in traditional Chinese culture. In fact, the idea of independence is often seen as a Western concept that can be challenging to apply in a collectivist society like China. In my upbringing, I was taught to prioritize family harmony and respect for elders, which means that children are expected to care for their parents in their old age.

In my opinion, children in China typically don't become independent from their parents until they get married and start their own families. Even then, it's common for adult children to continue living with their parents or providing financial support to them. This is because filial piety is highly valued in Chinese culture, and children are expected to show gratitude and respect to their parents by taking care of them.
