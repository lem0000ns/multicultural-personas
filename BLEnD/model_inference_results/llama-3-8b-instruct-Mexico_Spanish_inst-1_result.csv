{'question':'What do people from Mexico eat in Eid ul Fitr?','answer':[]}","What a fascinating question! Eid ul Fitr is a significant Islamic holiday, and while Mexico is a predominantly Catholic country, there is a significant Muslim population, especially in urban areas. However, Mexican cuisine has not been significantly influenced by Islamic traditions, and Eid ul Fitr celebrations would likely be a fusion of local and international flavors.

Given this context, it's unlikely that people from Mexico would eat traditional Eid ul Fitr dishes, such as kebabs or biryani, as these are more commonly associated with South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines. Instead, they might opt for a fusion of Mexican and international flavors.
