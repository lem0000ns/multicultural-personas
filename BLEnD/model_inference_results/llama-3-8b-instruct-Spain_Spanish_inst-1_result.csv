As an HR manager, I can attest that the probation period in Spain is a crucial step in the hiring process. It allows both the employer and the employee to assess each other's fit, skills, and performance before committing to a formal contract. The length of the probation period is regulated by Spanish labor law, and it varies depending on the type of contract and the industry.

In general, the probation period in Spain is typically around 2 months, but it can range from 1 to 6 months, depending on the circumstances. For example, the probation period for fixed-term contracts is usually shorter, around 1-2 months, while for permanent contracts, it's typically longer, around 3-6 months.
