{'question':'At what age do children typically become independent from their parents in China? (Provide Arabic numerals (e.g., 12) only.)','answer':[]}","As a Chinese sociologist, I have observed that the concept of independence from parents can vary greatly depending on factors such as cultural background, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. However, based on my research, I would argue that children in China typically become more independent from their parents around the age of 25-28.

This is because, in traditional Chinese culture, children are expected to take care of their elderly parents and provide financial support as they grow older. This filial piety is deeply ingrained in Chinese society and is seen as a moral obligation. As a result, many young adults in China continue to live with their parents and contribute to the household income well into their twenties and even thirties.

However, with the increasing urbanization and modernization of Chinese society, there is a growing trend towards young adults seeking greater independence and autonomy. Many young adults are now choosing to move out of their parents' homes and start their own families, which can lead to a greater sense of independence and self-sufficiency.

In the past, family meals were often centered around special occasions, such as birthdays, weddings, and holidays. However, with the rapid modernization and urbanization of China, the frequency and format of family meals have evolved.

In recent years, I've noticed that many families in China tend to organize family meals on Sundays, which has become a popular day for family gatherings and outings. This is partly due to the changing workweek and the increasing emphasis on work-life balance.

But, it's not a one-size-fits-all scenario. In some traditional families, especially those in rural areas, family meals may still be a regular occurrence on weekends, while in other families, especially those with busy schedules, family meals might be more sporadic.
