In my experience, children are often expected to take on more responsibilities and contribute to the family financially as they get older. However, the exact age at which children become independent from their parents can vary greatly depending on factors such as family background, education, and career choices.

In general, children in China tend to stay with their parents well into their 20s and even 30s. It's not uncommon for young adults to still live with their parents until they get married or establish their own households. In some cases, children may even continue to rely on their parents financially well into their 40s or even 50s.

That being said, there is a growing trend towards independence and self-sufficiency among younger generations in China. With the increasing cost of living and changing social norms, many young adults are seeking to break free from the traditional expectations of filial piety and establish their own independent lives.

{'question':'What food is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly in China?','answer':[]}","The question of food preferences across generations in China! It's a fascinating topic, indeed. You see, children in China often have a more sensitive palate, and they tend to prefer milder flavors and textures. On the other hand, the elderly have a more developed sense of taste and often appreciate stronger, more complex flavors.

One food that comes to mind that is typically disliked by children but enjoyed by the elderly is... (drumroll please)... Century Eggs! Yes, those infamous preserved eggs that have been fermented for several months or even years. Children often find the strong, sulfurous smell and slightly creamy texture unappealing, but the elderly appreciate the rich, savory flavor and the cultural significance of this traditional Chinese delicacy.

Here's the list:

{'question':'What do people in China traditionally eat on Christmas Day?','answer':[]}","What a great question! In China, Christmas is not a traditional holiday, and it's not widely celebrated. Christmas is actually a relatively recent introduction to China, mainly due to Western influence and globalization.

However, in recent years, Christmas has gained popularity in some urban areas, especially among younger generations and expats. Some people may choose to celebrate Christmas by adopting Western-style traditions, such as decorating trees, exchanging gifts, and eating festive foods.

In this context, some popular Christmas dishes in China might include:
