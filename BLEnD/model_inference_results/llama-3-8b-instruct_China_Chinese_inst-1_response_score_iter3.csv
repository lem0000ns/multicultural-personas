In China, the government has implemented strict regulations on religious education in schools. According to the Chinese Constitution, citizens have the freedom to believe in or not believe in a religion, but the government also has the authority to regulate religious activities.

In practice, this means that religious education is not explicitly taught in public schools, and students are not forced to follow a particular religion. However, students are required to study the basics of Chinese history, politics, and philosophy, which often includes the teachings of Confucius and the principles of socialism.

The government has also promoted the development of traditional Chinese culture and values, such as filial piety and respect for elders, which are often linked to Confucianism. However, this is not necessarily the same as teaching religion in a traditional sense.

In China, the highest paying professional sport is undoubtedly basketball, specifically the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) league. The CBA has been a major player in China's sports scene for decades, and its teams and players have become household names.

The CBA's popularity can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the country's love for basketball, the league's competitive nature, and the presence of top-level international talent. The league's top teams, such as the Beijing Ducks and the Guangdong Southern Tigers, are able to attract large crowds and generate significant revenue from ticket sales, merchandise, and sponsorships.

Moreover, the CBA has been able to leverage its popularity to secure lucrative broadcasting deals, with the league's games airing on major television networks and streaming platforms. This has allowed the league to generate significant revenue from broadcasting rights, which has helped to further boost its financial performance.

In addition, the CBA has also been able to attract top-level international talent, including NBA stars such as Stephon Marbury and Jeremy Lin, which has helped to increase the league's visibility and appeal to a wider audience.

You see, as a granny from a small village, I've observed that children often have a sweet tooth, whereas the elderly tend to appreciate more savory and nourishing foods.

In China, it's not uncommon for children to dislike certain dishes that are rich in umami flavor, such as fermented bean paste, pickled mustard greens, or dried fish with soy sauce. These flavors can be overwhelming for young palates. On the other hand, the elderly often develop a taste for these same flavors as they age, as they become more appreciative of the depth and complexity they bring to a dish.
