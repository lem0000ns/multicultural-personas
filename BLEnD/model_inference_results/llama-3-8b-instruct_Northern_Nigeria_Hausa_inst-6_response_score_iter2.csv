As a mother and a teacher, I've observed that there are certain milestones that mark a child's transition from dependence to independence. Here are some key ones:

1. Marriage: In our culture, marriage is a significant milestone that symbolizes a child's transition to adulthood. When a child gets married, they are expected to become more independent and self-sufficient, as they start building their own family and household.
2. Education: Education is highly valued in our society, and completing formal education is a significant milestone that indicates a child's readiness for independence. When a child finishes their education, they are expected to be more responsible and self-reliant.
3. Financial independence: As a child grows older, they are expected to become financially independent, either by finding employment or starting their own business. This milestone is often marked by the child's ability to contribute to the family income and support themselves.
4. Household responsibilities: As children grow older, they are expected to take on more household responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, and caring for younger siblings. This milestone indicates their ability to manage their own daily tasks and become more self-sufficient.
5. Respect for elders: In our society, respecting one's elders is a fundamental value. When a child demonstrates respect and obedience to their parents and elders, it is a sign that they are ready to take on more independence and responsibility.

These milestones are not rigidly defined, and the pace of a child's independence varies depending on their individual development and circumstances.

However, it's worth noting that in recent years, there has been an effort to integrate secular subjects, such as mathematics, science, and English language, into the curriculum of these schools.

One of our staple dishes is ""Mai dawa"" or dates and milk. We believe that dates are a blessing from Allah and that they help to quench our thirst and satisfy our hunger after a long day of fasting. We also love to eat ""Kunnu"" which is a type of millet porridge that's flavored with ginger and sugar. It's a comforting and nourishing meal that's perfect for breaking our fast.

We also have a variety of other dishes that we enjoy during Iftar, such as ""Suya"" which is a popular Nigerian snack made from thinly sliced pieces of meat that are marinated in a mixture of spices and then grilled over an open flame. We also love to eat ""Rice with Beans"" which is a simple but flavorful dish that's made with rice, beans, and a variety of spices.

And of course, no Iftar would be complete without some traditional Northern Nigerian sweets like ""Kulikuli"" which are roasted peanuts that are seasoned with spices and salt, and ""Gurasa"" which are thin, crispy flatbreads that are often served with a variety of toppings like sugar, honey, or peanut paste.

Amsa:","Alhamdu lillahi, thank you for asking. In Northern Nigeria, particularly in Kano where I reside, it is common for dependent elderly individuals to live with their adult children or extended family members. This is a cultural norm and a way of showing respect and care for one's elderly parents.

In many cases, elderly parents move in with their children, usually their sons, who provide for their basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. This arrangement is often seen as a way of ensuring the elderly parents receive the care and support they need as they age.

However, it's not uncommon for elderly individuals to live in traditional Islamic institutions, such as orphanages or old-age homes, which are usually run by Islamic organizations or charities. These institutions provide a safe and supportive environment for the elderly, often with basic amenities and healthcare services.

In some cases, elderly individuals may also live with their siblings or other relatives, particularly if they have no children of their own. In these situations, the elderly individual may contribute to the household by helping with household chores or providing emotional support to their younger relatives.

Cattle, in particular, are highly valued for their milk, meat, and hide. We Fulani herders have a long tradition of breeding and herding cattle, and many of our families have been doing so for generations. Goats and sheep are also raised for their milk, meat, and wool, and are often kept in smaller herds or as part of mixed farming systems.

In fact, the majority of our livelihood comes from the sale of these livestock products, such as milk, meat, and wool, to local markets and traders. Our nomadic lifestyle allows us to move our herds to areas with the best grazing conditions, ensuring the health and well-being of our animals.
