However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the traditional Mexican diet is influenced by the country's rich cultural heritage, which includes indigenous, European, and African influences.

Given the fact that Mexico is a predominantly Catholic country, it's likely that the majority of Mexicans do not observe Ramadan. However, there is a significant Muslim population in Mexico, particularly in cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey.

Assuming that some Mexicans do observe Ramadan, it's likely that they would adapt their traditional diet to accommodate the dietary restrictions of the holy month. This might involve substituting traditional meat-based dishes with vegetarian or vegan alternatives, avoiding pork and other haram foods, and increasing their consumption of dates, nuts, and dried fruits.
