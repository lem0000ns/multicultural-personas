In recent years, some Chinese cities with large Muslim populations, such as Xinjiang, Beijing, and Shanghai, have seen the emergence of Eid ul Fitr celebrations, with local mosques and Muslim communities organizing cultural events and feasts.

Given this context, it's possible that some Chinese people might participate in Eid ul Fitr celebrations and eat traditional Muslim dishes, such as kebabs, naan bread, and dates. However, it's essential to note that Eid ul Fitr is not a widely celebrated holiday in China, and most Chinese people would not typically associate it with their traditional cuisine.

* The school day is structured around a series of classes, with each class lasting around 45-60 minutes.

When it comes to eating utensils in China, there are many variations depending on the region, cultural background, and even personal preferences. However, in general, Chinese people commonly use a combination of utensils to enjoy their meals. Here's a breakdown:

* Chopsticks are the most iconic and widely used utensils in China, particularly for eating rice, noodles, and other Asian-style dishes.
* Spoons are often used for soups, desserts, and some traditional dishes like congee.
* Forks are not as commonly used in China, but they are gaining popularity, especially among younger generations and in urban areas.
* Knives are rarely used in traditional Chinese dining, as the emphasis is on using chopsticks to pick up food. However, some modern restaurants and Western-style dishes may use knives.

In China, the majority of schools, including public schools and most private schools, do not explicitly teach a specific religion. Instead, they focus on promoting the principles of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the country's socialist ideology. This is because China is an officially atheist country and the CCP has a strong influence on the education system.

However, some private schools, particularly those with a Christian or Muslim background, may incorporate religious teachings into their curriculum. Additionally, some schools may offer elective courses or extracurricular activities that focus on religious studies, but these are not mandatory.

Traditionally, Chinese literature classes focus on classical Chinese literature, including works from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE) to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912 CE). These works are considered the foundation of Chinese literature and are still studied today.

In addition to classical literature, modern Chinese literature is also an important part of the curriculum. Writers like Lu Xun, Mao Dun, and Ba Jin are commonly studied in literature classes, as they are considered pioneers of modern Chinese literature.
