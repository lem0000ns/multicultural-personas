Okay, I need to figure out the most popular prenatal education activity in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's healthcare and cultural practices. Azerbaijan is a country in the Caucasus region, and like many places, prenatal care is important. However, I'm not entirely sure about the specific activities that are most popular there.

First, I should consider common prenatal activities globally. These often include prenatal classes, nutrition workshops, exercise programs, and possibly traditional practices. But Azerbaijan might have its own unique aspects. For example, in some cultures, family involvement is key, so maybe activities that include family members are more common.

I remember that in some countries, government-run programs are prevalent. Azerbaijan has a public healthcare system, so maybe they have structured prenatal education programs through their health services. Alternatively, there might be a focus on traditional methods passed down through generations, such as herbal remedies or specific exercises.

Another angle is looking at the language. The question mentions Azerbaijan, so the answer should be in Azerbaijani context. However, the user provided the answer in English, so maybe the activity is known internationally. But I need to be careful not to assume.

I should also think about any recent trends. For example, in recent years, there's been an increase in online prenatal classes due to technology. However, in some regions, in-person classes might still be more popular.

Wait, but the user wants the answer based on the persona I created earlier. The persona is an expert in maternal health in Azerbaijan, possibly a midwife or educator. They would know local practices. Since I don't have specific data, I have to make an educated guess based on common practices in similar cultures.

In many countries, prenatal yoga or exercise classes are popular. However, in Azerbaijan, maybe traditional birthing classes or nutrition workshops are more common. Alternatively, if there's a strong healthcare system, they might have structured prenatal education programs that include both medical advice and cultural practices.

Another thought: in some Middle Eastern and Caucasian countries, there's a strong emphasis on family support during pregnancy. So activities that involve family members, like group classes where partners and family are included, might be popular.

But I need to make sure the answer is accurate. If I'm unsure, maybe the safest answer is that prenatal education in Azerbaijan includes a combination of medical check-ups, nutrition advice, and traditional practices, but the most popular activity might be prenatal yoga or similar exercises. However, without specific data, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the most",inst-4,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to create a persona for a language model to answer the question about the most popular prenatal education activity in Azerbaijan. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The persona must have expertise relevant to the question, provide cultural or linguistic context, guide accurate and culturally appropriate answers, and be concise.

First, the country is Azerbaijan, so I should think about their healthcare practices, cultural norms around pregnancy, and any traditional or modern methods they use. Prenatal education could involve classes, workshops, or traditional practices. I need to ensure the persona has knowledge of Azerbaijani healthcare systems and cultural aspects related to pregnancy.

Next, the question is about the most popular activity. I should consider if there are specific programs or classes commonly attended by pregnant women there. Maybe they have government-sponsored programs, or perhaps traditional birthing classes. Also, language is important—using Azerbaijani terms or understanding local terminology might be necessary. The persona should be aware of both modern medical advice and traditional practices.

Cultural context: In Azerbaijan, family support is important, so maybe activities that involve family members. Also, religious influences might play a role, though I should be careful not to assume. Linguistic context might involve using terms in Azerbaijani or understanding common phrases related to pregnancy.

I need to make sure the persona is an expert in maternal health in Azerbaijan, possibly a healthcare professional or educator. They should know the local healthcare policies, common practices, and cultural nuances. The answer should reflect that expertise, ensuring accuracy and appropriateness.

Wait, the user wants the persona to guide the model to provide accurate answers. So the persona should have the right background to inform the answer. Maybe a midwife or a prenatal educator in Azerbaijan. Including knowledge of both traditional and modern methods would be good. Also, understanding that in some cultures, prenatal education might focus on nutrition, exercise, or traditional remedies.

I should avoid assumptions not backed by data. For example, if I'm not sure if yoga is popular, maybe it's better to focus on known programs. Alternatively, if there's a government initiative, that could be the answer. But I need to make sure the persona can guide the model to the correct answer without making up information.

So, the persona should be someone with direct experience in Azerbaijan's prenatal education, possibly a healthcare provider or a cultural expert. They should be able to contextualize the answer within Azerbaijani society, considering both medical and cultural aspects. The answer should be concise, so the persona needs to be",,1,1.0

Okay, the user wants me to create a persona for a language model to answer a question about a popular beach sport in Azerbaijan. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the persona needs expertise directly relevant to the question. The question is about sports played on beaches in Azerbaijan. So, I should focus on sports that are commonly associated with beaches there. I know that volleyball is a popular beach sport globally, but I need to confirm if it's popular in Azerbaijan. Also, maybe there are local sports or traditional activities that are specific to the region.

Next, cultural or linguistic context. Azerbaijan is a country with a mix of cultures, influenced by both the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus region. The language is Azerbaijani, which is Turkic. Including knowledge of local traditions or how the Caspian Sea influences activities there would add cultural context. Maybe mention the Caspian coastline's role in sports.

Guiding the model to provide accurate and culturally appropriate answers. The answer should not just name a sport but also explain why it's popular there. For example, if volleyball is played on beaches, maybe it's due to the availability of beaches along the Caspian Sea or the Black Sea. Also, considering if there are any unique aspects, like local tournaments or cultural significance.

Direct, concise, and focused. The persona should be a short description starting with ""You are..."" without extra explanations. Need to make sure it's specific to Azerbaijan and the beach sport context.

Now, verifying if volleyball is indeed popular in Azerbaijan. I recall that Azerbaijan has a strong volleyball presence, both in indoor and beach volleyball. They have participated in international competitions. Also, the Caspian Sea coastline might have beaches where people play volleyball. Another possibility is water sports like windsurfing or jet skiing, but the question specifies ""play on the beach,"" which might lean more towards volleyball or maybe football (soccer), but that's usually on fields, not beaches. So volleyball seems the most likely answer.

Including the Caspian Sea in the persona would provide the necessary geographical context. Also, mentioning the influence of local culture on sports preferences. Maybe the persona should note that while volleyball is popular, other activities might be emerging due to tourism or modern influences.

Putting it all together: The persona should be an expert in Azerbaijani sports culture, specifically beach activities, with knowledge of the Caspian Sea's role and the popularity of volleyball. Highlighting the blend of traditional and modern sports, and the linguistic context","Beach volleyball is popular on the Caspian Sea coastline of Azerbaijan, where sandy beaches provide ideal conditions for the sport, and it is widely played both recreationally and competitively.",1,1.0

Okay, I need to create a persona for Azerbaijan that helps answer how long people there typically spend dining at a restaurant. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani culture and dining habits.

First, the country is in the Caucasus region, with a mix of Turkic and Persian influences. Meals are important in Azerbaijani culture, often social events. But the question is about the average time spent at a restaurant for dinner. I should think about typical dining durations there. In many Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, meals can be quite lengthy, especially if it's a family gathering or a special occasion. However, in urban areas, people might be more rushed.

But I need to be specific. I should check if there's any data or common knowledge about average dining times in Azerbaijan. Maybe in restaurants, dinner might take around 1.5 to 2 hours? But I'm not sure. Also, considering the cultural context, maybe dinner is a more leisurely affair, so maybe 2 hours on average? Or perhaps it's shorter in cities due to work schedules. Wait, the persona needs to guide the model to provide an accurate answer, so the expertise should be in Azerbaijani dining customs and possibly restaurant industry practices.

Also, the answer needs to be in Arabic numerals with one decimal, like 2.5. The persona should ensure that the model doesn't give a generic answer but one tailored to Azerbaijan's context. So the persona should mention knowledge of Azerbaijani dining habits, cultural aspects like meal duration, and maybe the types of meals served. Also, linguistic context—maybe the language used in restaurants, but the question is about time, so maybe less about language and more about cultural norms.

Putting it all together: The persona should be an expert in Azerbaijani dining customs, familiar with both urban and rural practices, aware of the social aspects of meals, and able to provide the average time based on cultural norms and possibly surveys or studies. The answer should reflect that average, perhaps 2.0 hours? Or maybe 1.5? I need to be cautious here. If I'm unsure, maybe the persona can guide the model to consider that in Azerbaijan, dinner at a restaurant typically takes around 2 hours, considering the social nature of meals and the types of dishes served, which might take longer to prepare or enjoy. But I should avoid making up numbers. Alternatively, if there's a common understanding, like in many countries, dinner might be 1",,1,1.0

Okay, I need to create a persona for Azerbaijan related to the most popular stew. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. The most famous dish is probably plov, which is a rice dish with meat and vegetables. But wait, the question is about stew. Maybe there's another dish. Oh, there's also dolma, which are stuffed grape leaves, but that's not a stew. Then there's kəfəl, which is a type of meat stew. Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me check.

Azerbaijani cuisine has several stews. Kəfəl is a traditional dish, but I think the most popular might be ""qazma"" or ""dolma"". Alternatively, maybe ""pilaf"" is considered a stew, but it's more of a rice dish. Wait, maybe the answer is ""qazma"", which is a meat and vegetable stew. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, ""kəfəl"" is a stew made with lamb and vegetables, sometimes with yogurt. Or maybe ""shish kebab"" is more of a grilled dish. Hmm, I might be confusing some terms here.

Wait, I should focus on the persona. The persona needs to have expertise in Azerbaijani cuisine, specifically stews. So the persona should be a culinary expert from Azerbaijan, knowledgeable in traditional dishes. They should know the cultural context, maybe mention the use of ingredients like lamb, rice, or specific spices.

Then, maybe specify the most popular stew as kəfəl or another name. But I need to make sure which one is actually the most popular. Alternatively, maybe it's ""qazma"". I need to be accurate here. Let me think again. Kəfəl is a stew made with lamb and vegetables, sometimes with yogurt. It's a staple in Azerbaijani cuisine. Qazma is a dish made with lamb and rice, but maybe it's more of a pilaf.

I should check if there's any specific event that's widely recognized. For example, ""Qara Dağlar"" (Black Mountains) is a popular song, but not sure if that's an event. Alternatively, maybe school festivals or competitions in arts and sports. Also, considering the influence of the country's culture, maybe events that promote national heritage, like traditional games or music.

The persona needs to be an expert in Azerbaijani education and culture. So, the description should mention expertise in Azerbaijani school systems, cultural practices, and social activities. Including knowledge of both traditional and modern influences would help. Also, linguistic context—maybe using Azerbaijani terms or understanding the language's role in social events.

Wait, the answer needs to be a short answer, so the persona should guide the model to provide that. The persona should ensure the answer is accurate and culturally appropriate. So, the persona should have knowledge of current trends in Azerbaijani schools, maybe recent data or common practices.

I should avoid assumptions. Maybe the most popular event is a school festival or a sports day. Alternatively, considering the importance of music and dance in Azerbaijani culture, perhaps traditional dance performances or music competitions. Also, maybe events that combine both, like cultural festivals with various activities.

Including the role of the education system in promoting such events. Maybe the persona should mention familiarity with both public and private schools in Azerbaijan. Also, understanding the social dynamics, like the importance of community involvement in school events.

I need to make sure the persona is concise. Start with ""You are..."" and then the description. Mention expertise in Azerbaijani education, cultural practices, and social events.

Okay, the user is asking for the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this. First, I know that Azerbaijan is a predominantly Muslim country, so Christmas isn't widely celebrated there. However, there might be some influence from Western culture, especially in urban areas or among younger generations.

I need to check if there are any Christmas songs that are popular in Azerbaijan. Maybe some Western songs have been translated or covered locally. For example, ""Jingle Bells"" or ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" might be known, but are they popular? Alternatively, there could be local Azerbaijani artists who have created Christmas songs, but I'm not sure about their popularity.

Another angle: maybe the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan is actually a traditional song that's played during the holiday season, even if it's not specifically Christmas. Or perhaps there's a song that's been adapted from a Western classic into Azerbaijani. However, without specific data on chart-topping songs in Azerbaijan during Christmas, it's hard to say.

Considering the cultural context, the answer might be that Christmas isn't widely celebrated, so there isn't a single popular Christmas song. But the user might expect an answer even if it's not very well-known. Alternatively, maybe ""Azerbaijan Christmas Carol"" or something similar exists, but I can't confirm that.

Since I don't have concrete information on the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan, the safest answer is that there isn't a widely recognized Christmas song due to the limited celebration of the holiday. However, some Western Christmas songs might be played in certain contexts. But the user wants a specific answer. Maybe ""Silent Night"" in Azerbaijani? Or perhaps ""Merry Christmas"" in Azerbaijani? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the example answer given by the user in the JSON format is just a placeholder. The user wants the assistant to provide the answer based on the persona. Since the persona is a cultural analyst with expertise in Azerbaijani music, the reasoning would be that Christmas isn't widely celebrated, so there's no single popular song. However, some Western songs might be played. But the answer needs to be concise. So the answer is that there is no widely recognized Christmas song in Azerbaijan, but if forced to name one, it might be a local adaptation of a Western song like ""Jingle Bells"" or ""Silent Night."" However, without specific data, it's better to state that Christmas isn't widely celebrated,",inst-4,1,"<think>
Okay, the user wants me to create a persona for a language model to answer the question about the most popular Christmas song in Azerbaijan. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The persona needs to have expertise relevant to the question, provide cultural or linguistic context, guide the model to give accurate and culturally appropriate answers, and be concise.

First, I need to consider Azerbaijan's cultural context. Azerbaijan is a country with a mix of Muslim and Christian influences, but Christmas isn't widely celebrated there due to the majority being Muslim. However, there might be some Christmas songs in the Azerbaijani music scene, possibly influenced by Western traditions or local adaptations.

The persona should have expertise in Azerbaijani music and cultural practices. Maybe someone who studies music in Azerbaijan or is a cultural analyst. They should understand the blend of Eastern and Western influences in Azerbaijani music. Also, since the question is about a specific song, the persona needs to know which songs are popular there, even if Christmas isn't a major holiday.

I should mention the linguistic aspect too. Azerbaijani is a Turkic language, so any Christmas songs might be in Azerbaijani or adapted from other languages. The persona should be aware of that. Also, considering the cultural sensitivity, the answer should note that Christmas isn't widely celebrated but there might be some local adaptations or Western-influenced songs.

Need to make sure the persona is direct and focused. Maybe something like: ""You are a cultural analyst specializing in Azerbaijani music and traditions. You understand the influence of Western holiday music on Azerbaijani artists and the limited celebration of Christmas in predominantly Muslim Azerbaijan. You provide accurate information on local adaptations of Christmas songs, if any, while respecting cultural contexts.""

Wait, but the user wants the persona to guide the model to provide accurate answers. So the persona should have the knowledge to know that Christmas isn't widely celebrated, but perhaps there are some songs. Maybe the most popular is a Western song that's been translated or covered locally. Alternatively, there might be a traditional Azerbaijani song that's played during the season, even if not specifically Christmas.

I need to ensure the persona can address both the cultural context and the music expertise. Also, the answer should be short, so the persona needs to be concise. Let me check if there's any known Christmas songs in Azerbaijan. Maybe ""Silent Night"" in Azerbaijani? Or perhaps a local artist's version of a Western song. But without specific data, the persona should guide the model to",,,

Okay, I need to create a persona for Azerbaijan that helps answer the question about the most popular fruit there. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's culture and agriculture.

First, Azerbaijan is in the Caucasus region, known for its diverse climate. They have a variety of fruits due to different regions. I remember that grapes are significant there, especially for wine production. Also, they have orchards with fruits like apples, pears, and maybe cherries. But the question is about the most popular. 

Wait, I think in Azerbaijan, grapes are not just for wine but also consumed fresh. Also, there's a fruit called ""qara meyve"" which is black fruits, but I'm not sure if that's a specific type. Alternatively, maybe apples are more commonly consumed. However, I should verify which is more popular. 

Culturally, Azerbaijan has a tradition of growing grapes, and they have a famous wine culture. But maybe the most popular fruit in terms of consumption is something else. Let me think about common fruits in their cuisine. Dried fruits like apricots and figs are also common, but those are dried. 

Wait, the question is about the most popular fruit. Maybe apples are more commonly eaten fresh. Or perhaps it's the grape, given their agricultural focus. Alternatively, maybe the answer is cherries or pomegranates. 

I need to make sure the persona includes expertise in Azerbaijani agriculture and cuisine. The persona should know about the country's fruit production and cultural preferences. Also, mention the linguistic context, like the Azerbaijani name for the fruit. 

So, the persona should be an agricultural expert or a food culture specialist from Azerbaijan. They would know that grapes are widely cultivated and used, but perhaps apples are more commonly consumed. Alternatively, the answer might be grapes. 

Wait, I should check reliable sources. According to some sources, Azerbaijan is known for its grape production, both for wine and fresh consumption. However, apples are also widely grown. But which is more popular? Maybe the answer is grapes, but I'm not 100% certain. 

Alternatively, the most popular could be the ""qara meyve"" which might refer to a specific type like blackcurrant or another berry. However, I'm not sure. 

Since the persona needs to be accurate, it's better to base it on known facts. Given that Azerbaijan has a strong grape-growing tradition, and grapes are a staple","Azerbaijan is renowned for its grape cultivation, both for wine production and fresh consumption, making grapes the most popular fruit in the country.",0,0

Okay, the user is asking about the most common form of private education in Azerbaijan. Let me think.

I know Azerbaijan has a mix of educational systems. There are international schools offering IB or Cambridge, which are popular for their global recognition. Then there are religious madrasahs, which are traditional Islamic schools. Also, bilingual private institutions are on the rise, especially with the emphasis on learning Azerbaijani and another language like English.

But the question is about the most common form. International schools might be growing, but maybe they're not the most common. Madrasahs have a long history and are still prevalent, especially in certain communities. However, the government has been pushing for reforms post-Soviet era, which might have increased the number of private schools following state curricula but with private management. Wait, but the user specified private education, so state-run schools aren't included.

Wait, in Azerbaijan, private schools can be either following the national curriculum or international ones. The bilingual private institutions might be more common because they cater to the demand for bilingual education, which is important for both local and international opportunities. Also, the country has a growing middle class that can afford private education, and bilingual schools might be more accessible than international ones, which are expensive.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: the prevalence of madrasahs. They are traditional and might be more common in certain regions. However, with the country's focus on modernization and integration into global education systems, maybe international schools are more common now. But the example given in the initial prompt mentions the prevalence of international schools, madrasahs, and bilingual institutions. The user's example answer might be expecting one of these.

Wait, the user's initial message says: ""You understand the prevalence of international schools offering IB or Cambridge curricula, the role of religious madrasahs, and the growing trend of bilingual private institutions."" So the answer could be any of these. But which is the most common?

Looking up data (from my knowledge), in Azerbaijan, the majority of private schools might be following the national curriculum but with private management. However, the question specifies ""private education,"" which could include both those and international schools. But the example answer might be different.

Okay, so I need to figure out which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Azerbaijan attend most frequently. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijan's education system.

Azerbaijan has a bilingual education system, with Azerbaijani as the primary language and Russian often taught as a second language. However, there's a growing emphasis on English, especially in private institutions. Private schools and academies are popular, especially in urban areas like Baku. These private institutes often offer specialized programs in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), foreign languages, and arts.

Now, considering the prevalence of these subjects, STEM is a big area. Many private academies focus on providing strong foundations in math and science, which are crucial for higher education and careers. However, foreign languages, particularly English, are also highly sought after. Since English is a global lingua franca, parents might prioritize language institutes to give their children an edge. 

But wait, there's also the arts. While arts education is important, it might not be as common as STEM or language institutes. So between STEM and foreign languages, which is more frequent? In many countries, private tutoring and institutes for math and science are common, but in Azerbaijan, with the push for international education, English might be a close competitor.

However, looking at specific data or reports, I remember that STEM subjects, especially math and physics, have a lot of private academies. For example, institutes like ""Azerbaijan International School"" or others might focus on preparing students for international exams like the IB or SAT, which require strong STEM skills. Also, the government has been promoting STEM education to align with global standards and economic needs.

But I should also consider that language institutes, especially for English, might be more numerous because of the high demand. However, the question is about which subject's academy students attend most frequently. If STEM is taught in more academies and students attend them more, then that would be the answer. Alternatively, if language institutes are more common, then that's it.

Another angle: in Azerbaijan, after school hours, students often attend private institutes for extra help. If the curriculum is rigorous, students might need more support in core subjects like math and science. Also, entrance exams for universities are competitive, so private academies might focus on these areas.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe looking at the prevalence of private institutes by subject. From what I've read, there are many private institutes offering STEM subjects",inst-4,1,"You are an education researcher specializing in Azerbaijani private schooling systems, with deep knowledge of the country’s academic trends, language education priorities, and the prevalence of private institutes offering STEM, foreign languages, and arts programs.

Okay, the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan. Let me think about the priorities in Azerbaijani education.

Azerbaijan has been focusing a lot on STEM subjects, especially math and physics. This is because they want to develop their technology and energy sectors. The government has been pushing for modernization and innovation, so STEM is crucial for that. However, Azerbaijani language and literature are also important for national identity. But the question is about the most important subject. 

In recent years, there's been a strong emphasis on STEM to prepare students for global competitiveness. So while language is important, the priority seems to be on math and physics. But the user wants a single answer. Maybe the answer is mathematics? Or physics? Wait, the example given in the question had a placeholder. Let me check the initial instructions again.

The user mentioned that the expert emphasizes STEM, particularly math and physics. But the answer needs to be concise. The reasoning should note the focus on STEM for technological advancement and the energy sector, even though Azerbaijani language is important for identity. So the answer is likely mathematics or physics. But which one? The initial prompt says ""particularly mathematics and physics,"" so maybe the answer is mathematics? Or maybe it's not specifying between them. Wait, the example answer might have been ""mathematics"" but the user's answer could be either. However, the user might expect a single subject. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Azerbaijani language. But the reasoning says that STEM is increasingly prioritized. 

Hmm, the user's instruction says ""provide a concise, culturally informed answer grounded in the country's educational framework and societal values."" So the answer is likely mathematics or physics. But the question is which is the most important. In Azerbaijan's curriculum, mathematics is fundamental for STEM fields, so maybe mathematics is the answer. The reasoning would mention STEM's importance, especially math and physics, but since the answer has to be one subject, mathematics is the most emphasized. Alternatively, maybe the answer is physics. Wait, the initial prompt says ""particularly mathematics and physics,"" so maybe the answer is both? But the user wants a single answer. 

Wait, the example answer in the user's message is a placeholder, but the user's own answer should be in JSON. The user's example shows that the answer is a single subject. Given that, and considering that math is a foundational subject for both science and technology, the answer is likely mathematics.

The clothing reflects modesty and practicality, with standardized colors and styles promoted by educational institutions.""}",inst-4,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to create a persona for a language model to answer the question about what clothing middle and high school students in Azerbaijan wear to school. Let me start by breaking down the requirements.

First, the persona must have expertise directly relevant to the question. So, the person should know about Azerbaijani education, school uniforms, or cultural norms regarding clothing. Maybe a teacher, education official, or someone familiar with Azerbaijani schools.

Next, cultural or linguistic context. Azerbaijan has a mix of traditional and modern influences. The country is in the Caucasus, so maybe there are some traditional elements in school uniforms. Also, considering the climate, Azerbaijan has varying temperatures, so clothing might be practical for that. Also, Islamic culture might influence modesty in dress, but since it's a school setting, uniforms might be standard.

The persona needs to guide the model to provide accurate and culturally appropriate answers. So, the persona should mention knowledge of Azerbaijani school policies, cultural norms, and maybe even regional differences if applicable.

They want it direct, concise, focused on the question. So no fluff. Start with ""You are..."" followed by the description.

Now, putting it all together. The persona should be someone like a school administrator or a cultural expert from Azerbaijan. Mentioning knowledge of school uniforms, cultural norms, and the blend of traditional and modern styles. Also, maybe noting that uniforms are common but with some variation based on region or school.

Wait, the user mentioned middle and high school students. In Azerbaijan, are there specific uniform requirements? I think many schools have uniforms, but it might vary. Also, considering the country's history, maybe there are influences from Soviet-era uniforms, but now more modern. Also, the language is Azerbaijani, so the persona should be fluent in that, but the answer is in English, so maybe not necessary to mention language unless it's relevant.

So the persona could be: ""You are a school administrator in Baku, Azerbaijan, with 15 years of experience overseeing student dress codes. You are well-versed in Azerbaijani cultural norms and education policies, and you understand the blend of traditional and modern influences on school uniforms. You provide clear, concise guidance on appropriate attire for students in middle and high schools across the country.""

Does that cover all points? Expertise in school dress codes (directly relevant), cultural context (blend of traditional and modern, Azerbaijani norms), guides for accurate answers. Direct and concise. Starts with ""You","School uniforms are common in Azerbaijani schools, influenced by both Soviet-era policies and modern practices. The clothing reflects modesty and practicality, with standardized colors and styles promoted by educational institutions.",1,1.0

Okay, I need to create a persona for Azerbaijan that's relevant to the question about office software used in the workplace there. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The persona must have expertise directly related to the question, provide cultural or linguistic context, guide the model to give accurate and culturally appropriate answers, and be concise.

First, the country is Azerbaijan. I should consider what office software is commonly used there. Microsoft Office is probably prevalent, but maybe there's a local alternative or something else. Also, considering the language, Azerbaijani is the main language, but Russian is also spoken in some contexts. However, the software might be in English, but maybe some localized versions exist.

Cultural context: Azerbaijan has a mix of traditional and modern work environments. Government and large companies might use Microsoft Office, while smaller businesses could use free alternatives like LibreOffice or Google Workspace. Also, due to possible internet restrictions or preferences, some might use domestic software solutions. But I need to verify if there's a specific local software. Alternatively, maybe they use a combination of Microsoft and Google tools.

Wait, I should check if there's any local software. I'm not sure, but maybe it's better to focus on the most common ones. Microsoft Office is definitely widespread globally, so likely in Azerbaijan too. However, considering cost, some might use open-source options. Also, in some countries, government policies push for local software, but I don't know if that's the case in Azerbaijan. Maybe mention both Microsoft and Google Workspace, and possibly LibreOffice as an alternative. Also, note that English is commonly used in business, so software interfaces might be in English.

Cultural context: The persona should reflect understanding of Azerbaijani business practices, maybe the preference for certain software due to training, availability, or government support. Also, the linguistic context: Azerbaijani is Turkic, but software interfaces are often in English. However, some localized versions might exist, but I'm not certain. Maybe the persona can mention that while English is dominant in software, some users might have Azerbaijani language support.

Putting it all together: The persona should be an IT professional in Azerbaijan with knowledge of local software trends, understanding of both international and local tools, and awareness of language preferences. They should guide the answer to include Microsoft Office as primary, mention Google Workspace and LibreOffice as alternatives, and note the use of English in software despite the local language being Azerbaijani.

Make sure it's concise, starts with ""You are","Microsoft Office dominates due to its prevalence globally and in corporate settings, while Google Workspace and LibreOffice are used for cost-effectiveness.

Okay, the user is asking about family-related holidays in Azerbaijan. Let me think. The main ones are definitely Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. These are Islamic holidays, so they're significant in Azerbaijani culture. During Ramadan, families fast together, and there's a lot of emphasis on communal prayers and charity. Then Eid al-Fitr comes at the end of Ramadan, which is a time for feasts, giving gifts, and family gatherings. Similarly, Eid al-Adha is another major holiday with similar traditions of feasting and family time. Also, maybe some traditional Azerbaijani holidays like Novruz, but the user specifically mentioned family-related, and Novruz is more about the New Year and spring. However, the question might be focusing on Islamic holidays since the user mentioned Islamic holidays in the initial prompt. Wait, the user's initial instruction said they are a cultural expert in Azerbaijani traditions and Islamic holidays, so the answer should include both Islamic and any other family-related holidays. But the example answer given by the user includes only the Islamic ones. Let me check the original question again. The user's question is ""What are the family-related holidays in Azerbaijan?"" So I need to include all family-related ones. However, in Azerbaijan, the main ones are indeed the Islamic ones, but there's also Novruz. However, the user's initial prompt mentioned family customs during Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha, so maybe they are focusing on Islamic holidays. But the user's question is broader, asking for family-related holidays. So I should include both Islamic and Novruz. Wait, but the example answer provided by the user in the initial prompt (the one with the example format) had the answer as ""Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha."" So maybe the user expects only the Islamic ones. Also, the user mentioned they are a cultural expert specializing in Azerbaijani traditions and Islamic holidays, so perhaps the answer should focus on the Islamic ones. But to be thorough, I should check if there are other family-related holidays. Novruz is a traditional holiday, but it's more about the New Year and is celebrated with family as well.

Okay, the user wants me to create a persona for Azerbaijan related to popular snacks. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani cuisine. They have a rich culinary tradition with dishes like plov and kebabs, but the question is about snacks. So I need to think about common street foods or everyday snacks.

First, the persona needs expertise directly relevant to the question. That would be someone knowledgeable in Azerbaijani food culture. Maybe a food historian or a local chef? Also, cultural context is important. Azerbaijan has a mix of Persian, Turkish, and Caucasian influences. Snacks might include things like paklava, but that's more of a dessert. Wait, there's also dishes like dolma, but those are more main courses. Maybe things like shish kebab, but again, that's a meal. Wait, snacks could be lighter. What about meyve (fruit) or nuts? Or maybe specific pastries?

I should check if there are traditional snacks specific to Azerbaijan. For example, ""sığır"" is a type of flatbread, but I'm not sure if that's a snack. Also, ""gözleme"" is a stuffed flatbread, which might be eaten as a snack. Then there's ""tandır"" which is a dish cooked in a pit, but again, maybe not a snack. Maybe ""qara qoz"" (black caviar) but that's more of a delicacy. Oh, and ""manti"" are dumplings, but again, more of a main dish. 

Wait, maybe I should think about street food. In many countries, snacks include things like fried items. In Azerbaijan, ""səbzi"" is a salad, but that's a side dish. ""Pilav"" is rice, but again, a main dish. Maybe ""qoz"" (caviar) is a snack? Or ""məmməd"" which is a type of cheese? Or ""beyaz qoz"" (white caviar) from fish roe. Also, ""mədət"" is a type of cheese. 

Another angle: Azerbaijani snacks might include sweets like ""sahlab"" (a dessert made with milk and orchid), but that's more of a drink. ""Laz"" is a type of flatbread. Maybe ""dolma"" is sometimes eaten as a snack. Also, ""qara qoz"" is","These items are commonly consumed as street food or everyday snacks, reflecting Azerbaijan's culinary traditions and regional influences.",1,0.5

Okay, I need to figure out who the most popular soccer coach in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling any notable coaches from Azerbaijan. I know that Azerbaijan has had some coaches in both domestic and international settings.

First, I remember that Rashad Eshrefov is a well-known name. He was the head coach of the Azerbaijan national team for a while. But I'm not sure how long he's been in that role or if he's still active. Also, there's the possibility that a coach from a top club in Azerbaijan might be more popular than the national team coach. 

Another name that comes to mind is Safar Abasov. He was the coach of the national team in the past, maybe around 2015. However, I think he was replaced by Eshrefov later. Then there's the current head coach of the national team, which might be someone else now. Wait, I should check the latest information. But since I can't access current data, I have to rely on what I know up to 2023.

Also, there's the possibility that a club coach in a top league team like Qarabag or Neftchi might be more popular. For example, coaches like Elmar Huseynov, who has been with Qarabag for several years. However, popularity might depend on the team's performance and media presence.

But the question is about the most popular, which might be more subjective. National team coaches often have higher visibility. If Rashad Eshrefov was coaching the national team during a successful period, he might be considered more popular. However, if there's a recent coach who led the team to notable achievements, that person might be more popular now.

Wait, I also recall that in 2022, the national team coach was Rashad Eshrefov, but he was replaced by another coach. Maybe by 2023, the current coach is someone else. But without up-to-date info, it's tricky. However, Safar Abasov was the coach until 2015, and then Rashad Eshrefov took over. If Eshrefov is still coaching, he might be the most popular. Alternatively, if there's a new coach, maybe someone like Orxan Huseynov, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: sometimes, coaches who have been with the national team for a long time or have achieved good results are",inst-4,1,You are a sports journalist,,0,0

Okay, so I need to create a persona for a language model to answer the question about which writers are commonly studied in Azerbaijani literature classes. Let me think about the requirements. The persona must have expertise directly relevant to the question, provide cultural or linguistic context, guide the model to give accurate and culturally appropriate answers, and be concise.

First, the country is Azerbaijan. The question is about commonly studied writers in literature classes there. So the persona should be an expert in Azerbaijani literature. Maybe a literature professor or a cultural researcher. They need to know the curriculum and the key authors taught in schools.

I should mention the main literary movements in Azerbaijan. The 19th and 20th centuries are important, like the Azerbaijani Enlightenment and the Soviet era. Key authors might include Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, who is a foundational figure. Then there's Mikayil Mushfig, a poet from the early 20th century. Samed Vurgun is another poet, maybe from the Soviet period. Also, people like Rasim Bahrami and Huseyn Javid, who are part of the ""New Wave"" movement. 

Cultural context: Azerbaijani literature has a rich tradition, influenced by Persian and Turkic cultures. The use of the Azerbaijani language in education is crucial here. The persona should emphasize the inclusion of both classical and modern authors, maybe noting that the curriculum reflects national identity and historical periods. Also, the role of the Soviet era in shaping the literary canon, with authors like Samad Vurgun and others who were prominent during that time.

I need to make sure the persona includes expertise in Azerbaijani literature, knowledge of the educational system's curriculum, and the cultural significance of the authors. Avoid any extra information, just the persona description starting with ""You are..."".

Wait, the user said to be direct and concise. So list the key authors without going into too much detail. Mention the periods and movements they belong to. Also, note the linguistic context, like the use of Azerbaijani language in literature and education. Maybe the influence of Persian and Turkish literature?

So putting it all together: You are a literature professor specializing in Azerbaijani literature, with expertise in the country's literary canon and educational curriculum. You are familiar with key authors from the 19th century to contemporary times, including Mirza Fatali Akhundzade, Mikayil Mushfig, Samed Vurgun","These writers are foundational figures in Azerbaijani literature, representing key periods such as the Enlightenment, Soviet era, and modernist movements, and are included in the national curriculum to reflect cultural and historical heritage.",1,0.2
