Okay, the user is asking about the most popular stew in Azerbaijan. Let me think. I know that Azerbaijan has a rich culinary tradition with various stews. The main ones I remember are dolma, which is stuffed grape leaves, but that's more of an appetizer. Then there's khash, which is a soup made from cow's feet, but that's more of a winter dish and maybe not a stew. There's also pilaf, but that's a rice dish. Wait, maybe it's dushbara? No, that's more like dumplings. Oh, right! The most popular stew is probably ""pilaf"" but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe ""shish"" or ""kufte""? No, those are different. Wait, I think the most common stew is ""dolma"" but I'm confused because sometimes it's categorized as a stew. Alternatively, maybe ""khash"" is considered a stew. But I need to be accurate.

Okay, so the user is asking which meal is the most important in Azerbaijan. Let me think. I know that in many Muslim countries, the main meals are often around the times of prayer, like suhoor before dawn and iftar after sunset. But Azerbaijan is a secular country now, though it has Islamic roots.

In Azerbaijani culture, the main meals are sahar (breakfast), öğle (lunch), şəria (afternoon tea), and axşam (dinner). I remember that breakfast, especially in the morning, is considered important because it's the start of the day. But there's also a tradition called ""sahar"" which is more about the first meal after waking up. However, in some regions, the main meal might be at night, like axşam, especially in rural areas where people might work longer hours.

Wait, but I think the most important is actually the evening meal, axşam. Because in many cultures, the family gathers in the evening, and it's a time for togetherness. Also, in Azerbaijani traditions, the evening meal is often the largest and most elaborate, with dishes like plov, dolma, and various meats. It's also when they might have their main course and socialize with family. However, some sources might say that the main meal is at noon, öğle, especially in more traditional or religious contexts where lunch is the biggest meal.

But I need to check if there's a consensus. Considering the influence of Islamic practices, iftar (the meal to break the fast during Ramadan) is a significant meal, but that's a specific time. Normally, the main meal might be axşam because it's the time when the family is together. However, in some regions, especially those with agricultural backgrounds, the main meal could be at lunchtime when people return from work. But in urban areas, maybe dinner is more important.

Hmm, I think the answer is axşam (dinner) because it's the time when the family gathers and the meal is the most elaborate. But I need to be careful. Some sources might say öğle is the main meal. Wait, I should verify. In Azerbaijani culture, the main meal is often considered to be axşam, the dinner, as it's a time for family and the largest meal of the day. However, in some contexts, especially in more traditional or religious settings, the main meal might be at noon",inst-4,5,"You are an expert in Azerbaijani food culture, with comprehensive knowledge of all traditional meals (sahar, öğle, şəria, axşam), their historical roots, regional variations, and roles in social, religious, and familial contexts.

Okay, so I need to figure out who the most well-known and successful entrepreneur in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani business figures. The country has a significant energy sector, especially oil and gas, which is a major part of its economy. There's also growth in technology and other industries.

First, I remember that Heydar Aliyev was a prominent figure, but he was more of a political leader, not an entrepreneur. Then there's Rovshan Mammadov, who is associated with the Azneft company, which is involved in oil refining. But I'm not sure if he's the most well-known.

Another name that comes to mind is Samir Sultanov. He's the founder of Azercell, which is Azerbaijan's leading mobile operator. Azercell has been around for a while and has played a significant role in the country's telecommunications sector. That might make Sultanov a major entrepreneur.

Then there's Rashad Eyyubov, who is the founder of the Azadi TV station. However, media might not be as economically impactful as energy or technology sectors. 

In the energy sector, there's also the state-owned SOCAR, which is a major player. But the question is about entrepreneurs, not necessarily state figures. However, some entrepreneurs might have ties to SOCAR or other state enterprises.

Another possibility is Samir Asadov, who is involved in various business ventures, including real estate and construction. But I'm not sure about his international recognition.

Wait, the user mentioned considering international recognition, innovation impact, and cross-sector influence. So someone who has not only built a successful business in Azerbaijan but also has a presence globally. Samir Sultanov with Azercell might have more international ties compared to others. Azercell has partnerships with international companies, which could contribute to his prominence.

Alternatively, there's also the case of Farhad Mirzayev, who is the founder of the ""SABIC"" company, but I'm not certain about his ranking.

I think the key here is to determine who is most recognized both domestically and internationally. Given that Azercell is a major telecom provider, Sultanov might be more prominent. However, I should verify if there are other entrepreneurs in different sectors with higher profiles.

Another angle: some sources might point to Rashad Eyyubov for his media influence, but again, the question is about economic success. The energy sector, being the backbone of Azerbaijan's economy",inst-4,5,"You are an Azerbaijani business historian and global entrepreneurship expert with comprehensive knowledge of Azerbaijan's economic ecosystem.

Okay, the user is asking who the most popular sportsperson in Azerbaijan is. Let me think about this.

First, I need to consider the sports that are prominent in Azerbaijan. They have a strong history in chess, weightlifting, wrestling, and football. Chess is particularly notable because Azerbaijan has produced world champions like Garry Kasparov, although he's from Russia but trained there. Wait, no, Kasparov is Russian, but Azerbaijan has had other chess stars. Maybe Teimour Radjabov? He's an Azerbaijani chess grandmaster and has been quite successful. 

Then there's weightlifting. Azerbaijan has had successful weightlifters in the Olympics, like Rafig Aliyev. But I'm not sure if he's the most popular. Wrestling is another big sport; they have wrestlers who have won medals in the Olympics and World Championships. 

Football (soccer) is also popular. Azerbaijan has had players in European leagues, like Samir Sediqov, but I don't know if he's the most popular. Maybe someone else? 

I should check recent data. Teimour Radjabov has been a top chess player for years, and chess is a major sport in Azerbaijan. The government supports chess a lot, so he might be the most popular. However, there's also the case of weightlifters like Hidayat Heydarov, who has won multiple Olympic medals. 

But considering media exposure and national pride, chess might have more visibility. Radjabov has been a consistent top player, so he might be the answer. But I need to confirm if there's a more recent or more popular figure. Maybe someone from football? However, I'm not sure about current football stars in Azerbaijan. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is Garry Kasparov, but he's actually from Russia, though he has Azerbaijani heritage. Wait, Kasparov was born in Baku, but he's considered Russian. So maybe not. 

So, the most likely answer is Teimour Radjabov in chess. But I should also consider if there's a more recent athlete. Let me think. In the past few years, maybe someone else? Or is Radjabov still the top? 

Another angle: the user might be expecting a footballer, but I don't recall a footballer being as dominant as a chess player in terms of national recognition. So I'll go with Teimour Radjabov as the most popular sportsp",inst-4,5,"You are a comprehensive sports sociologist specializing in Azerbaijani sports culture, with expertise in multiple disciplines including chess, weightlifting, wrestling, and football.

Okay, so the user is asking which subject's academy or private educational institute middle or high school students in Azerbaijan most frequently attend. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall the education system in Azerbaijan. I know that after primary school, students go to middle school (which is grades 6-9) and then high school (grades 10-11). Private institutes are common there, especially for subjects that are considered important for higher education or standardized tests.

In many countries, subjects like math, physics, and languages are popular for private tutoring. But in Azerbaijan, there's a strong emphasis on the Unified State Exam (OGÉ and EGE), which is crucial for university admissions. So students might focus on subjects that are part of these exams. 

Looking at the most competitive subjects, math and physics are often areas where students seek extra help. Also, English is important for international opportunities. However, I've heard that in Azerbaijan, private academies for math and physics are quite prevalent. They might offer specialized programs or exam prep.

Another angle: the country's education system might have certain trends. For example, if the national curriculum places a heavy emphasis on STEM subjects, then private institutes in those areas would be more common. Alternatively, if there's a cultural preference for certain subjects, that could influence attendance.

Wait, I should check if there's any data or reports on this. But since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on existing knowledge. From what I remember, Azerbaijani students often attend private institutes for math and physics, especially for competitions or to improve their scores in the EGE. Also, English language institutes are popular, but maybe math and physics are more frequent.

Another thought: in some countries, private schools or institutes for the humanities are common, but in Azerbaijan, the focus might be more on sciences due to university entrance requirements. So the answer might be math or physics. However, the question says ""academy/private educational institute,"" which could be more specific. Maybe the most common is math, as it's a foundational subject for many fields and heavily tested.

Alternatively, could it be the Russian language? Since Russian is widely spoken in Azerbaijan, but that's more of a language subject. However, the Unified State Exam includes Russian, so maybe students attend institutes for that too. But I think math and physics are more likely.

I think the answer is mathematics. Private academies for math are common because of the high competition in the EGE and",inst-4,5,You are an education expert,,1,1.0

Okay, the user is asking which subject is considered the most important for students in Azerbaijan. Let me think about this.

First, I know that Azerbaijan's education system emphasizes certain subjects based on their cultural, economic, and strategic priorities. The national curriculum includes subjects like mathematics, science, Azerbaijani language, and literature. But which one is the most important?

Looking at the country's focus areas: Azerbaijan has been investing in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) to support economic development, especially with their oil and gas industry and recent diversification into tech. However, the Azerbaijani language is also crucial for preserving national identity and culture. 

But wait, the question is about the most important subject. In many countries, mathematics is foundational for other sciences and is often prioritized. However, in Azerbaijan, there's a strong emphasis on the native language as part of cultural preservation. However, considering the curriculum structure and the number of hours allocated, mathematics might be more emphasized in terms of teaching hours and resources. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is Azerbaijani language and literature, as it's a core subject for national identity. But I need to check if there's any official data or educational policies that highlight one subject over others. 

Another angle: the Ministry of Education's priorities. If they have initiatives promoting STEM, math might be highlighted. But language is also a key part of the curriculum. However, the question is about what's considered most important, which could be a matter of perception. 

In some contexts, mathematics is seen as essential for critical thinking and future careers. But in Azerbaijan, given their history and current development goals, maybe mathematics is the most important. However, I should verify if there's a consensus or official statement. 

Wait, I recall that in the Azerbaijani education system, mathematics is a core subject with significant emphasis, especially in primary and secondary education. It's a prerequisite for many other subjects and is often a focus area for standardized testing. 

So, the answer might be mathematics. But I need to ensure that there isn't a stronger emphasis on the native language. However, the question is about importance, which could be subjective. If the user is looking for the subject that's most prioritized in the curriculum, mathematics is likely the answer. 

But I should also consider that the Azerbaijani language is taught as a compulsory subject from an early age, which is vital for cultural preservation.

Okay, I need to figure out which job is considered underpaid in Azerbaijan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Azerbaijani public administration and labor policies. The user mentioned wage structures, government employment practices, and socio-economic factors.

First, I remember that public sector jobs in Azerbaijan often have fixed salaries set by the government. These salaries might not keep up with inflation or the cost of living, leading to perceptions of underpayment. Also, there's a cultural expectation that public service jobs are stable but not highly paid. 

Looking at specific professions, teachers and healthcare workers are often cited in many countries as being underpaid. In Azerbaijan, education and healthcare are public services, so their salaries might be set by the state. If the state budget doesn't allocate enough, these sectors could suffer. Additionally, regional disparities might mean that people in rural areas have lower wages compared to urban centers, but the question might be looking for a specific profession rather than a region.

Another angle is the comparison between public and private sector salaries. If private sector jobs offer higher pay, then public sector roles might be seen as underpaid. However, the question is about which job specifically. 

I've also heard that in some cases, civil servants or government officials might have lower salaries compared to other countries, but that's not always the case. However, if the government is facing budget constraints, they might not increase wages, leading to underpayment. 

Putting this together, the most likely answer is public sector jobs, specifically teachers or healthcare workers. But the user wants a single job. Maybe the most commonly cited one is teachers. Alternatively, it could be government clerks or other administrative roles. Wait, in the example given by the user, the answer was ""public sector jobs,"" but maybe in Azerbaijan, it's more specific. 

Wait, I should check if there's a specific profession known for underpayment. In some contexts, teachers are often mentioned. However, in Azerbaijan, maybe healthcare workers? Or perhaps the answer is more general. Let me think again. The user wants a single job. The example answer was ""public sector jobs,"" but maybe in the context of Azerbaijan, the answer is ""public sector employees"" or a specific role. 

Alternatively, considering the socio-economic factors, if the state budget is low, then public sector salaries are low. So the answer might be public sector jobs. But I need to confirm.

Okay, the user is asking which food is a cost-effective and quick meal option in Azerbaijan. Let me think about Azerbaijani cuisine.

First, cost-effective usually means something that's cheap but filling. Quick meal options are probably things that don't take long to prepare. In Azerbaijan, plov is a staple dish. It's rice-based, often with lamb or vegetables, and it's a common dish in many households. But is it quick? Well, cooking rice can take some time, but maybe there are quicker versions.

Then there's dolma, which are stuffed grape leaves. But those might take longer to prepare, especially if you're making them from scratch. Shashlik is grilled meat, which is popular, but you need a grill and it might not be as quick for a household meal.

Wait, maybe it's something like ""pilaf"" but I think plov is the same as pilaf. Alternatively, there's ""tandır"" which is slow-cooked, so that's not quick. What about ""kərə"" (khash)? No, that's a slow-cooked soup. 

Wait, maybe ""şirin pilav"" or ""shirin plov""? No, that's sweet rice. Maybe ""dolma"" is quicker if using store-bought grape leaves. Or maybe ""sığır"" (beef) dishes? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: ""qurut"" (dried meat) is used in various dishes. But that's more of an ingredient. 

Alternatively, ""yufka"" (thin flatbread) with various fillings. But making yufka can be time-consuming. 

Wait, maybe ""pilaf"" is the answer. Because it's a one-pot meal, uses rice which is cheap, and if you have the ingredients on hand, it's quick. Also, in Azerbaijan, rice is a common base for many dishes, and plov is a traditional dish that's both economical and can be made in bulk. 

Another angle: economic factors. Rice is a staple, so it's likely cheaper. Using lamb or vegetables as the protein source can vary, but maybe with vegetables it's more cost-effective. 

So the answer is likely plov. But I need to confirm if it's considered quick. Cooking rice takes time, but maybe compared to other dishes, it's quicker. Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker version like ""sığır pilavı""",inst-4,5,"You are an expert in Azerbaijani cuisine, food economics, and cultural practices, with deep knowledge of local ingredients, traditional cooking methods, and household meal habits.

Okay, so I need to figure out who the most popular volleyball player in Azerbaijan is. Let me start by recalling what I know. The user mentioned that they track athlete popularity through social media analytics, Azerbaijani sports media coverage, and fan engagement at both national and club levels. 

First, I should consider current national team players. Azerbaijan has a men's and women's national volleyball team. Maybe the captain or a star player from either team? For example, in men's volleyball, there's been some attention on players like Elmar Huseynov or others. But I'm not sure about their current statuses.

Then there's the club scene. Azerbaijan has clubs participating in European leagues, like the men's club in the CEV Champions League. Players from these clubs might have higher visibility. For instance, maybe someone like Ramil Guliyev, who plays for a club and has been in the national team. However, I need to check if he's still active and his recent performance.

Social media presence is crucial. I should think about who has the most followers on Instagram or Telegram. Maybe a player who's active on social media, engages with fans, or has a large following. Also, media coverage in Azerbaijani-language outlets would highlight certain players. If a player is frequently mentioned in news articles, interviews, or has won awards, that could indicate popularity.

Recent achievements matter too. If a player has won a major tournament, been named MVP, or has a high ranking, that would boost their popularity. For example, if a player from the national team won a medal in the European Championships or Olympics, they might be the most popular.

Wait, but I need to make sure the information is up-to-date. Let me think: as of 2023, who are the prominent players? Maybe Elmar Huseynov is still active. Or perhaps someone like Sardar Mammadov, who has been part of the national team. Alternatively, maybe a female player if the question isn't gender-specific. However, the user didn't specify gender, so I should consider both.

Another angle: public recognition events. If a player has been honored with awards or has a large fan base, that's a sign. Maybe a player who's also involved in community work or has a strong personal brand.

I'm a bit uncertain because I don't have real-time data.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many subjects are taught in middle schools in Azerbaijan according to the 2023-2024 guidelines. The user specified to exclude electives and only count core subjects. Let me recall the structure of the Azerbaijani curriculum.

From what I remember, the Ministry of Education in Azerbaijan has a set number of core subjects that are mandatory for all students in grades 5 through 9. Electives aren't counted here. Let me think about the typical subjects. There's Azerbaijani language and literature, mathematics, science (which might be split into different subjects like biology, physics, chemistry?), history, geography, physical education, music, art, maybe foreign languages like English. Wait, but in some cases, subjects might be combined or split differently.

Wait, in the 2023-2024 guidelines, there was a reform where some subjects were merged. For example, natural science might be taught as a single subject in certain grades, then split into separate sciences in later grades. But the core subjects would still be counted as individual ones once they're split. Also, there's moral education, maybe? Or is that part of another subject?

I need to be precise. Let me try to list them out based on the official framework. The core subjects typically include:

1. Azerbaijani Language and Literature
2. Mathematics
3. Natural Science (might be split into Biology, Physics, Chemistry in later grades)
4. History of Azerbaijan
5. World History
6. Geography
7. Foreign Language (usually English)
8. Physical Education
9. Music
10. Art
11. Information Technology
12. Civic Education (or Moral Education)
13. Physical Education (Wait, is that separate from PE?)

Wait, maybe some of these are combined. For example, in some grades, Natural Science is a single subject, but in others, it's split. However, the Ministry's guidelines might count each of these as separate core subjects once they are split. Also, there's a subject called ""Civic Education"" which is mandatory. So adding that up, maybe 12 subjects? Let me check again.

Another approach: I recall that in the 2023 reforms, the number was adjusted to 12 core subjects. Let me confirm.
