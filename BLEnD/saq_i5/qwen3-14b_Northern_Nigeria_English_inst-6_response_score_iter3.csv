Okay, the user is asking about the typical workday duration in Northern Nigeria, specifically in hours. They want the answer in Arabic numerals and up to three answers if needed. Let me think.

First, I know that Northern Nigeria has both formal and informal sectors. The formal sector might follow standard business hours, maybe 8-5 or similar, but the informal sector could vary. Also, Islamic work culture is important here. Daily prayers are a big part of the workday. The five daily prayers—Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha—each have specific times. These prayers might cause work hours to be split or adjusted around them.

In the formal sector, maybe businesses operate from 8 AM to 5 PM, but with breaks for prayers. However, in the informal sector, especially in markets or small businesses, hours might be more flexible. Some places might start later in the day, like after Dhuhr prayer, which is usually around noon. So, maybe the workday isn't a strict 8-hour day. Also, considering the prayer timings, people might work shorter hours to accommodate the prayers, especially in the informal sector.

But I need to be precise. Let me recall. In some regions, the workday might be around 8-9 hours, but with breaks for prayers. However, in the informal sector, the duration could be less structured. The user might be looking for a range. For example, formal sector could be 8 hours, informal maybe 6-7 hours. But the question asks for a single answer or up to three. Since the user said ""a typical workday,"" perhaps the answer varies between sectors. However, without specific data, it's hard to say. But I think the common answer is that the formal sector follows 8 hours, but with prayer breaks, so maybe 8 hours. However, in reality, the informal sector might have shorter hours. But the question doesn't specify sector, so maybe the answer is 8 hours, but I should check if there's a standard.

Alternatively, considering Islamic work culture, the workday might be split into two parts: morning and afternoon, with a break for Dhuhr and Asr prayers. So maybe 6-7 hours total. But I need to confirm. Maybe the average is around 8 hours, but with variable breaks. Since the user wants the answer in hours, and considering both sectors, the answer might be 8,",inst-6,3,"You are a labor economics expert specializing in Northern Nigeria's formal and informal sectors, with deep knowledge of Islamic work culture, including daily prayer timings",,1,1.0

Okay, the user is asking for a popular second language in high schools in Northern Nigeria. Let me think.

First, I know that Northern Nigeria has a strong Islamic influence. Arabic is significant there because of religious education. Many schools, especially those with Islamic studies, teach Arabic as part of their curriculum. Also, Arabic is used in religious texts like the Quran, so it's a key subject for students in Islamic schools.

Then there's English. It's the colonial legacy and the official language of Nigeria. Most schools, both secular and Islamic, use English as the medium of instruction. So English is definitely a major second language. But the question is about a popular one, so maybe the answer is Arabic or English?

Wait, the user specified ""second language."" In Northern Nigeria, the primary language might be Hausa or another local language. So the second language would be either English or Arabic. But which is more popular? English is widely used across the country, but in the North, Arabic is also prominent in Islamic education. However, in high schools, English is more commonly taught as the second language because it's required for higher education and exams. But I need to check if Arabic is considered a second language or a subject. Maybe in Islamic schools, Arabic is a core subject, making it a second language for many students there. However, in general, English is the primary second language taught in schools across Nigeria, including the North. So the answer might be English. But the example given in the question might have Arabic. Wait, the user is from Northern Nigeria, and the answer could be Arabic. But I need to be precise. Let me recall: In the North, Islamic schools (like the ones under the Ministry of Education) teach Arabic as a subject, but English is the medium of instruction. However, in many cases, students learn both. But the question is about a popular second language. Since English is the lingua franca and required for exams, it's more likely the answer. However, if the question refers to a language other than the local language (like Hausa), then both English and Arabic are candidates. But the user's example answer might have Arabic. Wait, the example isn't given here. Let me think again. The user is asking for a popular second language. In Northern Nigeria, the primary languages are Hausa and others. So the second languages would be English and Arabic. But which is more popular? English is taught in all schools, while Arabic is more specific to Islamic schools",inst-6,3,"You are an education expert specializing in Nigerian language policies, with deep knowledge of Northern Nigeria's school curriculum, Islamic education, and secular educational systems.

Okay, I need to answer the question about a popular activity in Northern Nigerian parks. Let me recall what I know. The user mentioned that the assistant is a cultural anthropologist specializing in Northern Nigerian park ecosystems, focusing on traditional games, seasonal festivals, and socio-cultural dynamics of public green spaces. They also mentioned activities like wrestling matches and storytelling sessions.

So, the question is asking for a popular activity. From the example given in the user's message, wrestling matches and storytelling are mentioned. But I should check if there are other common activities. Traditional games might be another possibility. However, the example answer provided by the user in the JSON format example was ""traditional wrestling matches,"" which was based on the information given.

Wait, the user's example answer was ""traditional wrestling matches"" with reasoning that parks host wrestling matches as part of cultural events. So, maybe that's the primary answer. But are there others? The user also mentioned storytelling sessions. So perhaps both wrestling and storytelling are valid. However, the question asks for a single answer or up to three. Since the example answer uses one, maybe the main one is wrestling. Alternatively, maybe the answer should list multiple if needed. But the user's example only had one answer. Let me check the original question again.

The user's question says ""Provide a single answer... or up to three if needed."" So if there are multiple, they can be listed. However, in the example format, the answer is a single string. So maybe they want a list of up to three activities. But the example given by the user in the JSON format shows a single answer. Wait, the user's example response was:

So the answer is a single string. Therefore, even if there are multiple activities, the answer should be a single string listing them. For example, ""traditional wrestling matches, storytelling sessions, and seasonal festivals."" But I need to check the original context.

The user's initial message says that parks host both informal gatherings and formal cultural events like wrestling matches and storytelling sessions. Also, traditional games are part of the expertise. So possible activities include wrestling, storytelling, and traditional games. But the example given by the user in their own message was wrestling matches. So maybe the answer is traditional wrestling matches. Alternatively, the answer could be a combination.

Okay, so the user is asking about the age at which children typically become independent from their parents in Northern Nigeria. They want the answer in Arabic numerals, and if there are multiple answers, up to three. The response needs to be in JSON format with ""answer"" and ""reasoning"" keys.

First, I need to recall the cultural norms in Northern Nigeria, specifically among the Hausa-Fulani communities. From what I know, in many traditional societies, children might stay with their parents until they get married. But I should check if there's a specific age mentioned in studies or ethnographic research.

I remember reading that in some parts of Northern Nigeria, especially in rural areas, children might not leave home until their late teens or early twenties. However, there's also the influence of modernity and urbanization. In urban areas, maybe the age is lower. But the question doesn't specify rural or urban, so I should consider the general case.

Hausa-Fulani society often has a system where children, especially girls, might stay with their parents until marriage, which could be around 18-20. Boys might leave earlier for education or work, but that's not always the case. However, there's a saying that in some regions, the age could be as high as 25. But I need to verify if there's a commonly cited age.

Wait, some sources indicate that in traditional settings, children might not become fully independent until marriage, which varies. But perhaps the typical age range is around 18-25. However, the user wants a specific number. If I have to choose a single answer, maybe 18 is common for girls, but in some cases, it's higher. Alternatively, maybe 20 is the average. I need to ensure the answer is accurate.

Another angle: in some parts, children might start living independently when they start working, which could be around 15-16, but that's not full independence. Full independence, like moving out, might be later. Since the question is about becoming independent, perhaps the answer is 20. However, I should check if there's a standard answer in anthropological studies.

After checking, some studies suggest that in many parts of Northern Nigeria, especially in rural areas, children may not leave their parents' home until their late teens or early twenties, with 18 to 25 being a common range. But the exact age can vary based on factors",inst-6,3,"You are a cultural anthropologist specializing in ethnographic studies of generational independence in Northern Nigeria, with expertise in Hausa-F",,1,1.0

Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the month when final exams are usually scheduled in high schools in Northern Nigeria. They want the answer in Arabic numerals, 1-12.

First, I need to recall the school calendar structure in Northern Nigeria. I know that many schools there follow a three-term system. The terms are usually divided to avoid the hot season, which is around April to June. So the first term might be January to March, the second term April to July, but that's during the rainy season. Wait, maybe I should think about the typical split.

In many parts of Nigeria, the academic year starts in September. So Term 1: September to December, Term 2: January to March, Term 3: April to July. But the final exams would be at the end of each term. However, the question is about the final exam term, which might refer to the last term of the academic year. If the academic year ends in July, then the final exams would be in July. But wait, sometimes schools might have the last term in June. Alternatively, considering the three-term system, the final term is often Term 3, which would be in June or July. But the user is asking for the month, so maybe July is the answer. However, I should check if there's a standard month.

Wait, the user mentioned Northern Nigeria specifically. The climate there might have a different schedule. The harmattan season is from November to February, which is dry. Then the rainy season starts in March. So schools might avoid the rainy season. So Term 1: September to November, Term 2: February to April, Term 3: June to July. That way, the final exams in Term 3 would be in July. But some schools might have the last term in June. Alternatively, maybe the final exams are in June. I need to be precise.

Alternatively, I remember that in some states, the final exams are in June. Let me think. If the academic year is divided into three terms, the final term might be Term 3, which is usually in May to July. So the exams would be in June or July. However, the most common answer I've heard is that the final exams are in June. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the three terms are often split as Term 1: September to December, Term 2: January to March, Term 3:",inst-6,3,"You are a senior education administrator in Northern Nigeria with comprehensive expertise in the region's academic calendar, including the scheduling of final exams in high schools.

Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the first day people celebrate after a child is born in Northern Nigeria. Hmm, I need to recall the cultural practices there. I remember that in many parts of Nigeria, especially in the north, there are traditional ceremonies following a birth.

Wait, there's something called the ""Ade"" ceremony. I think that's a Yoruba tradition, but Northern Nigeria is more Hausa-Fulani. Maybe it's different. Oh, right! In Northern Nigeria, the celebration might be called ""Waka"" or ""Sarauta."" Let me think. The first day after birth might not be the main celebration. Sometimes the celebration happens on the 7th day, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 40th day is significant. Wait, but the question is about the first day after birth. 

Wait, could it be the 7th day? Or maybe the 1st day is just the birth, and the celebration is the next day? Or perhaps the answer is the 40th day, but that's for some other reasons. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the 7th day, known as ""Sarauta"" in some cultures. But I need to be precise. 

I think in some Northern Nigerian cultures, the first celebration after birth is the 7th day, called ""Sarauta"" or ""Waka,"" where the community gathers to celebrate and the child is named. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the 40th day. Wait, I should check. But since I can't look it up, I have to rely on existing knowledge. 

Another angle: In Islamic traditions, which are prevalent in Northern Nigeria, there's a ceremony called ""Aqiqah"" performed on the 7th day, involving the sacrifice of an animal. So maybe the celebration is on the 7th day. But the question is about the first day after birth. So the answer might be the 7th day. But the user is asking for the first day people celebrate after the birth, which could be the same day or the next day. However, in some cultures, they wait a few days before celebrating.

Okay, so I need to figure out what the most popular indoor sport in Northern Nigeria is. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in that region. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so maybe sports that are culturally acceptable and don't involve alcohol or other restrictions would be more popular. Indoor sports... Well, common indoor sports globally are things like basketball, table tennis, badminton, or maybe even indoor soccer. But I need to think about local preferences.

I remember that in many parts of Africa, football (soccer) is super popular, but that's usually played outdoors. However, maybe there are indoor versions or similar games. Wait, but the question specifies indoor. In some places, they might play basketball in gyms or community centers. Also, traditional games might be played indoors. But are they considered sports? Maybe not. 

Another angle: community centers in Northern Nigeria might offer activities that are both affordable and fit within cultural norms. Sports like table tennis or badminton require minimal equipment and can be played indoors. However, I'm not sure if they're the most popular. Alternatively, maybe something like wrestling or martial arts, but those are usually outdoor or in specific venues.

Wait, there's a sport called ""Kabaddi"" which is popular in some parts of India, but I don't think that's in Nigeria. Maybe indoor games like chess or checkers? But those are more mind games than physical sports. 

Another thought: in areas where facilities are limited, people might improvise. For example, using makeshift courts for football or basketball indoors. But again, is that considered the most popular? Or maybe volleyball, which can be played indoors. However, I'm not certain about the prevalence of volleyball in Northern Nigeria.

I should also consider if there are any traditional indoor sports. For example, some cultures have games that are played with balls or sticks, but I'm not sure about specific names. Alternatively, maybe indoor sports like boxing or martial arts, but again, not sure about popularity.

Wait, I've heard that in some parts of Nigeria, indoor sports like table tennis and badminton are gaining traction, especially in urban areas with better facilities. However, in rural areas, maybe it's different. But the question is about Northern Nigeria overall, both urban and rural. 

Another possibility is that football is adapted indoors, but that might not be as common. Alternatively, maybe the popularity of indoor sports is lower compared to outdoor, but the question is about the most",inst-6,3,"You are a cultural expert in Northern Nigeria with specialized knowledge of indoor sports trends, community center activities, and sports facility usage patterns across urban and rural regions.

Okay, I need to create a persona for Northern Nigeria related to the question about underpaid jobs. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The persona must have expertise relevant to the question, provide cultural or linguistic context, guide the model to give accurate and culturally appropriate answers, and be concise.

First, the question is about which job is considered underpaid in Northern Nigeria. So the persona should be someone who knows the local job market there. Maybe a labor economist or someone with experience in that region's economy. Also, considering cultural context, Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, so maybe including religious or traditional aspects might be relevant. Also, the region has a lot of agriculture, maybe that's a sector where jobs are underpaid. Or perhaps teaching or public sector jobs? I should think about common perceptions of underpaid jobs there.

I need to make sure the persona includes expertise in labor economics or social work focusing on Northern Nigeria. Maybe mention knowledge of local economic conditions and cultural values. Also, linguistic context: Hausa is widely spoken, so including that could help. The persona should guide the model to answer based on local perceptions and economic factors. Maybe mention specific sectors like education, agriculture, or informal sectors. Also, ensure that the answer is culturally appropriate, so avoiding stereotypes but acknowledging common issues like low wages in certain professions.

Wait, the user said to be direct and concise. So the persona should be a single sentence starting with ""You are..."" and include all the necessary elements. Let me try to combine these aspects: expertise in labor economics, knowledge of Northern Nigeria's job market, cultural context (Hausa language, Islamic values), and sectors where underpayment is common. Maybe mention teaching or public service as examples. But need to keep it concise. Let me draft something like:

""You are a labor economist specializing in Northern Nigeria's job market, fluent in Hausa, and knowledgeable about local economic challenges and cultural values, particularly the perception of underpayment in sectors like education and public service.""

Does that cover all points? Expertise in the relevant area, cultural/linguistic context, guides to accurate answers, concise. I think that works. Maybe check if there are more common underpaid jobs. Maybe also mention informal jobs or specific roles. But the example given in the persona is education and public service, which are common in many regions. Alternatively, maybe include agriculture? But the user wants it to be direct. I think the example is okay. Let me make sure it starts with ""You are"" and","Public school teachers in Northern Nigeria are often perceived as underpaid due to low salaries, limited benefits, and high workloads, despite their critical role in education.",0,0

Okay, I need to figure out which professional sport is the highest paying in Northern Nigeria. Let me start by recalling what I know about sports in that region. Northern Nigeria is predominantly Muslim, and there's a strong cultural emphasis on traditional sports and games. However, professional sports in the region might be influenced by both local traditions and global trends.

First, I should consider the major sports that have professional leagues or organized competitions. Football (soccer) is a global sport with significant following, but I'm not sure if it's the highest paying in Northern Nigeria specifically. Then there's boxing, which has some prominent fighters from the region, like Muhammad Ali, although he's more associated with the United States. But maybe there are other boxers from Northern Nigeria who have made it big.

Another angle is traditional sports. For example, wrestling is a big deal in many parts of Nigeria, including the north. There's a sport called ""Danda"" or ""Kanuri wrestling"" which is traditional. However, these might not be professionalized in the same way as global sports. But if they are part of local festivals or have sponsors, they could generate income.

Then there's the aspect of patronage systems. In many parts of Nigeria, traditional rulers and wealthy individuals sponsor sports events, which might influence which sports get more funding. If a sport has strong patronage, it might have higher revenues.

I also need to think about the economic factors. Which sports have national or international exposure that could lead to higher earnings? For instance, if a sport has a professional league with TV rights, sponsorships, and prize money, that would be a factor. Football has leagues like the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL), but I don't know if the top teams are based in the north. Similarly, basketball might have some presence, but I'm not sure about its popularity in the north.

Wait, but the question is about the highest paying professional sport. In many regions, boxing can be lucrative for top fighters, even if the sport isn't as popular as football. If there are boxers from Northern Nigeria who are successful internationally, that could be a contender. However, I'm not certain if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe horse racing or other sports with betting and gambling aspects, but I don't think that's a major sport in the north. Another possibility is athletics, but again, not sure about the professional structure there.

I might need to check if there are any notable professional sports leagues or athletes from Northern",inst-6,3,"You are a cultural and economic anthropologist specializing in the intersection of sports, tradition, and economics in Northern Nigeria.

Okay, the user is asking which writers are commonly studied in literature classes in Northern Nigeria. Let me recall the literary traditions there. Northern Nigeria has a rich tradition of Arabic and Hausa literature, so pre-colonial and Islamicate scholars would be important. Alhaji Umaru Garki comes to mind as a classical figure. Then there's the Sokoto Caliphate's Islamic scholarship, maybe authors like Abubakar Imam or others from that era.

In postcolonial times, Shehu Sani is a modern writer from the North, known for works like ""Kano"" and ""The City of the Dead."" Also, maybe some English-language authors from the region. But the question specifies Northern Nigeria, so focusing on Hausa and Arabic writers. However, in school curricula, there might be a mix. Wait, the user mentioned that the professor is familiar with both classical figures and postcolonial authors. So including both Alhaji Umaru Garki and Shehu Sani makes sense. Also, maybe writers like Ahmadu Bello, but he's more of a political figure. Or perhaps contemporary Hausa prose writers. But the example answer given in the user's message includes Alhaji Umaru Garki, Shehu Sani, and maybe others. I think the answer should list the most commonly studied ones, so Garki, Sani, and maybe someone else like Abubakar Imam or others from the Sokoto Caliphate. But since the example answer only lists two, maybe the main ones are Garki and Sani. Alternatively, including three names if needed. Let me check the initial instruction: ""up to three if needed."" So the answer should be concise, maybe two or three names. So the answer would be Alhaji Umaru Garki, Shehu Sani, and perhaps another like Abubakar Imam or someone else from the Islamicate tradition. But I need to be sure. The user's example answer includes two names, but the instruction allows up to three. So I'll go with the main ones: Alhaji Umaru Garki, Shehu Sani, and maybe a third. However, if the common curriculum includes only those two, then just them. I think the answer is Alhaji Umaru Garki and Shehu Sani, as they are the most prominent. The reasoning would be that they represent classical and postcolonial traditions in",inst-6,3,"You are a Nigerian literature professor specializing in the entire literary tradition of Northern Nigeria, with expertise in pre-colonial Arabic and Hausa oral storytelling, Islamicate scholarship from the Sokoto Caliphate, and postcolonial authors.
