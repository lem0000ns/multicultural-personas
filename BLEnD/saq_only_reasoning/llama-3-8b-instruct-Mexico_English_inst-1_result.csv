","The question ""What do people from Mexico eat in Eid ul Fitr?"" is an interesting one, as Eid ul Fitr is a significant Islamic holiday, but Mexico is a predominantly Christian country with a small Muslim population. This raises the question of whether Eid ul Fitr is even widely celebrated in Mexico, and if so, what kind of cuisine would be associated with it.

Given the cultural context, it is unlikely that Eid ul Fitr is widely celebrated in Mexico, and therefore, there may not be a specific traditional Mexican cuisine associated with this holiday. However, for the sake of curiosity, let's assume that some Mexican Muslims, particularly those living in urban areas with a significant Muslim population, might still observe Eid ul Fitr and celebrate with traditional Islamic dishes.
