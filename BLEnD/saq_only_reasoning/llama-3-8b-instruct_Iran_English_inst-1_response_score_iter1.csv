","What a fascinating question!

While Iran is a landlocked country, it does have a long coastline along the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea. Given the country's geography and culture, it's not surprising that beach activities are not as prominent as in coastal countries. However, Iranians do enjoy spending time near the water, and some beach activities have gained popularity in recent years.

Here's my answer:

{""answer"": [{""sport"": ""Surfing""}], ""reasoning"": ""While not a traditional Iranian sport, surfing has gained popularity in recent years, particularly among the younger generation. The country's coastal regions, such as Kish Island and Qeshm Island, offer suitable conditions for surfing, making it a popular beach activity among Iranians.""}",inst-1,1,,,0,0
